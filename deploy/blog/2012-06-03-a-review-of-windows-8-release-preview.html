<p>Microsoft released Windows 8 Release Preview on Friday, June 1st.  And I just wanted to start a game playthrough on Sunday.  Wish me luck, as I want to do both <span class="caps">ASAP</span>.  Here we go&nbsp;again!</p>
<p><em>Notice: Please read <a href="http://kwpolska.tk/blog/2012/03/05/a-look-at-windows-8-consumer-preview/" title="A Look at Windows 8 Consumer Preview — Kw’s Blog">A Look at Windows 8 Consumer Preview</a> first.</em>

<h1>Déjà vu time:&nbsp;Setup.</h1>
<p>Another offer of an <code>.exe</code>.  I did not accept it.  Downloaded the <span class="caps">ISO</span>, it was quite&nbsp;fast.</p>
<p>Anyways, I created a new <span class="caps">VDI</span> and ran the <span class="caps">ISO</span>.  I was greeted by a screen with the Windows word on it and a throbber (not depicted on the screen, shot it too fast).  Notice that the word doesn’t look quite right.  It is made for 16:9 screens: when you do use a 16:9 screen (depicted below), it is stretched, what gets its proper look&nbsp;back.</p>
<p>The setup program hasn’t changed too much.  But in the Repair section, the fonts look a tiny bit different and <span class="caps">CMD</span>’s scrollbar is now Metro-ish.  And Microsoft changed the setup icon again: now it&#8217;s an arrow pointing to a screen.  Or: a&nbsp;tablet.</p>
<p>On the product key screen, I discovered that the right-click menu style is from Office <span class="caps">XP</span> or Windows Whistler betas, released eleven years ago.  And I am dead serious.  Just look at it.  Apparently, Microsoft loves going back to the past: in terms of movement, Metro apps are even more limited than Windows 1.0.  Especially when you’re a few pixels short from the “proper” screen resolutions according to Microsoft.  And when you need more than ⅓ or ⅔ of your screen for your&nbsp;apps.</p>
<figure>

</figure>

<p>License screen, the same scrollbar as in <span class="caps">CMD</span>.  I came back to the <span class="caps">CMD</span> immediately.  Right-clicked the titlebar and I got even more new <span class="caps">UI</span> elements.  New buttons and other controls.  (keep in mind that the setup is composed of images of fake controls and even more fake glass, which hasn’t changed to reflect the new&nbsp;glass.)</p>
<figure>

        <figcaption>Setup: New controls in <span class="caps">CMD</span>.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Also, why do they even ask me for the product key?  There is one for the whole&nbsp;world.</p>
<p>After the install finished, let’s say hi to our new&nbsp;<span class="caps">OS</span>.</p>
<p>Restart.  Getting stuff ready.  Restart.  The boot logo is still for 16:9&nbsp;displays.</p>
<figure>

        <figcaption>New Windows boot logo.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>And we go through the <span class="caps">OOBE</span> again.  First change: <span class="caps">MORE</span> <span class="caps">COLORS</span>!  Then I decided not to choose express settings, although this won’t make a big difference.  Sign in with a Microsoft account?  Sure, but first I look at the “local account” procedure, which gives you the details of both choices, something that should be displayed instead of the Microsoft login prompt.  Put in my e-mail address, I do exist, I am asked for my password, I give it,  then I get a request for <em>security verification info</em>.  I like that idea.  Done.  Creating my account.  Hold on for a second, a new mail message.  It tells me that I added a phone number to my account.  Good to know.  Back to writing this post.  Another one!  A new mail address.  Ten seconds pass,  you’ve got mail!  They want me to confirm this <span class="caps">PC</span> as a trusted <span class="caps">PC</span>.  So be it, we click all the three links and go back to Windows&nbsp;8.</p>

<h1>Welcome to Windows&nbsp;8!</h1>
<p>It greeted me with a different start screen wallpaper, a quite pretty Desktop wallpaper, and without my avatar.  After a short while, the Desktop tile went black (so did my wallpaper) and the Photos tile now displays photos from my SkyDrive.  App rundown?  <span class="caps">APP</span>&nbsp;<span class="caps">RUNDOWN</span>!</p>
<p><strong>Mail.</strong>  Can’t see a change since last time.  And you get to see <span class="caps">YET</span> <span class="caps">ANOTHER</span> <span class="caps">GOG</span>.<span class="caps">COM</span> <span class="caps">NEWSLETTER</span>.  They know when to send one.  And they’re awesome.  But I just noticed an overall <span class="caps">UI</span> change: the toolbar-ish things accessed by a right-click now get the selected item displayed in a square.  That&#8217;s made especially for PCs, as you can now use this from your keyboard.  And yes, that fancy Menu key on your keyboard (left of Right Ctrl) does&nbsp;work.</p>
<p><strong>People.</strong>  Again, my Android/Google contacts list appear.  My login details are shared from Mail.  And I just noticed that the wait cursor changed.  It is now a plain light blue square with a bit darker.  Metro style.  Then I notice that <span class="caps">EVERY</span> <span class="caps">SINGLE</span> password input offers you a button to see your password, and every other input field has an × button to quickly erase.  And I am now authenticating <em>Application for Windows Phone (via Windows Live)</em>.  It says it will take a few minutes, much longer than my Gmail account.  I won’t even bother waiting.  Or wait, it’s done!  New tile: I get to see 5 avatars of people I follow on Twitter (as my Google contacts don’t have any as I never bothered and don’t even care.  But I <span class="caps">DO</span> get to see my Google avatar out there&nbsp;sometimes.)</p>
<p><strong>Messaging.</strong> Supports <span class="caps">WLM</span> and Facebook only.  I am not very happy about&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>Desktop is left for the end, so <strong>Calendar.</strong>  And I see three calendars: Windows Live Mail (light blue), GMail (green) and National Holidays (purple).  I also noticed that I forgot to put an event somewhere.  Fixed.  Quite nice way to manage your stuff.  (on a related note: my clock is set terribly wrong and I can’t easily change&nbsp;that.)</p>
<p><strong>Photos.</strong>  SkyDrive, kwpolska-win, Pictures lib— hold on for a second.  Kwpolska-win?  Those are all the photos from my Windows 7 with SkyDrive.  Nice.  Anyways: Pictures library, Facebook, Flickr.  And a pretty&nbsp;background.</p>
<p><strong>Video</strong> (Xbox Live-related).  Just some video-related stuff, you can also watch your local&nbsp;videos.</p>
<p><strong>Weather.</strong> Location services will fail, so we won’t use them.  Instead of getting Seattle as a default, I get to enter my location.  Let’s get quite close to myself and let’s choose&nbsp;Celsius.</p>
<p><strong>Internet Explorer</strong> (10).  I want to enter an address, but I see that <strong>it remembered my history from Consumer Preview.</strong>  Useless for me.  Shot a screenshot of my website, and I got the new wait cursor on the&nbsp;image.</p>
<p><strong>Store.</strong>  No changes since last time.  Installing (for an additional test): msnbc.com, Evernote, Fruit Ninja and Wikipedia.   The store connection failed quite often.  The “try again” link out there failed to work.  So&nbsp;bad.</p>
<p><strong>Maps.</strong>  No, not gonna use location services.  First of, scrolling to zoom doesn’t work, and it sucks.  Second of, my city sucks on the&nbsp;map.</p>
<p><strong>SkyDrive.</strong>  Still awesome, just as in&nbsp;<span class="caps">CP</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Music.</strong> Same as Video.  This time, I get to play some local music, from Portal 2 <span class="caps">OST</span>.  The background doesn’t showcase <span class="caps">MY</span> songs, I do not have any other music in my SkyDrive.  Overall, it’s a nice management <span class="caps">UI</span>.  Although I won’t use one, as all music management on this machine belongs to <span class="caps">MPD</span> (even on Windows, a bit cheaty setup, but worth&nbsp;it)</p>

        <figcaption>Music: Playlist: Portal 2 <span class="caps">OST</span>.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><strong>Xbox <span class="caps">LIVE</span> Games.</strong>  That should be pretty much&nbsp;obvious.</p>
<p><strong>Camera.</strong>  Don’t have&nbsp;one.</p>
<p><strong>News.</strong> We encounter a new app: Bing News.  It should be obvious what it means.  New live&nbsp;tile!</p>
<p><strong>Sports.</strong> I hate those.  Bing Sports.  Nothing more.  Live tile unlocked.  Sort of like game&nbsp;achievements.</p>
<p><strong>Travel.</strong>  Bing Travel.  Live&nbsp;tile.</p>
<p><strong>Finance.</strong> Yup, you’ve guessed it: Bing Finance + another live&nbsp;tile.</p>
<p>And, while we’re at it, our 4 new&nbsp;apps.</p>
<p><strong><em>Evernote.</em></strong> A nice app, I must&nbsp;admit.</p>
<p><strong><em>News on msnbc.com.</em></strong>  Better than the Bing News.  Pretty.  I also learned something.  (see the gallery if you wanna know what do I&nbsp;mean)</p>
<p><strong><em>Fruit Ninja.</em></strong>  What does that × mean?  Oh, it’s broken.  Great.  It can’t be fixed by Windows 8.  What do you expect?  Like something is gonna work&nbsp;here?</p>
<p><strong><em>Wikipedia.</em></strong>  Works okay, but it could’ve been&nbsp;better.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Apps rundown: quite good apps out there.  Lotsa live tiles, and that’s good.  But this thing has <span class="caps">HORRIBLE</span> <span class="caps">NOTIFICATION</span> <span class="caps">SYSTEM</span>.  Can’t they copy the great system from many mobile OSes, like Android or iOS?  Once a notification disappears, it’s gone&nbsp;forever.</p>
<p>And here comes my start screen state right now. (dropped the desktop background for a second or&nbsp;two)</p>
<figure class="unlimitedfigure">

        <figcaption>Full Metro start screen.</figcaption>

<h1>Settings&nbsp;rundown</h1>
<p>Time to run down all the settings you get.  Fire up charms, Settings, More <span class="caps">PC</span>&nbsp;Settings.</p>
<p><strong>Personalize.</strong> Nothing&nbsp;new.</p>
<p><strong>Users.  Notifications.  Search.  Share.</strong>&nbsp;Obvious.</p>
<p><strong>General</strong> or settings-we-couldn’t-fit-anywhere-else.  I get to set my clock properly, and <em>Advanced startup</em> = F8 in older Windowses.  <span class="caps">TODO</span> <span class="caps">DOES</span> F8 <span class="caps">WORK</span> <span class="caps">TODO</span> <span class="caps">PORTAL</span> 2&nbsp;<span class="caps">SS</span></p>
<p><strong>Privacy.</strong>&nbsp;Standard.</p>
<p><strong>Devices.</strong> You can choose not to download drivers on metered connections.  For crying out loud, who cares?  People on tablets don’t even <span class="caps">NEED</span> drivers!  And people on the desktop wouldn’t want to wait for&nbsp;them!</p>

        <figcaption><span class="caps">PC</span> settings: Devices.  Note the “Download over metered connections” section.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><strong>Ease of Access.  Sync your settings.  HomeGroup.  Windows Update.</strong> Don’t even&nbsp;ask.</p>
<p>That was quite short, wasn’t it?  But I covered them in the <span class="caps">CP</span> review, and they haven’t changed&nbsp;much.</p>
<h1><span class="caps">DESKTOP</span></h1>
<p>Welcome to the desktop.  First of, let’s change our wallpaper.  I have no idea why it’s black, but let’s get back to the default one.  Right click, Office <span class="caps">XP</span> menu.  Personalize, and I get to see new stuff.  Everything lost its glassy Aero feel.  It is now much different.  It is more Metro-ish.  Look below: many controls at once, as many as I can put on one screen.  They aren’t&nbsp;pretty.</p>
<figure class="unlimitedfigure">

        <figcaption>Most of the new <span class="caps">UI</span> elements on one screen.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There isn’t, unfortunately, too much to showcase in terms of&nbsp;apps.</p>
<p>But!  In terms of <span class="caps">OS</span> behavior, I found a few changes.  I also noticed that it takes <span class="caps">AGES</span> to shut the system down or to sign into the&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>First of, I wanted to play my music in the Music app.  I could’ve just clicked on something and it would play, but I wanted to have it locally forever and I wanted my playlist to work.  I wanted to play the Portal 2 <span class="caps">OST</span>, which is in my SkyDrive.  The only option I found was to select a file and then use <em>Save local</em>.  I could also select more than one.  I found an easier and faster solution: downloading a <code>.zip</code> from skydrive.live.com.  But later, I decided to actually try this <em>Save local</em> thing.  It did its job&nbsp;right.</p>
<p>The first time I tried to play a .m3u file, I got a Metro-style window asking me whether it should use Music or Windows Media Player. (screenshots depict “Open with”.)  I do not like that.  Mixing two environments went too far&nbsp;here.</p>
<p>Then, I created a .bmp file on my desktop.  It had the icon of Photos from Metro.  When it opened, I got a notification: “You have new apps that can open this type of file.”  Clicked and I got yet another window of this style.

        <figcaption>Photos: You have new apps that can open this type of file. (1/2)</figcaption>
</figure></p>
<h1>Control&nbsp;Panel</h1>
<p>They had to change stuff and drop everything related with the old Windows.  First of, System and Security in Control Panel’s category view have a plain blue shield instead of one with the Windows flag colors.  (Windows 7 <span class="caps">CP</span> included for comparison;  visual style is Soft7&nbsp;2.0)</p>
<p>But we have some&nbsp;changes!</p>
<p><strong>Add features to Windows 8.</strong>  Or: Windows Anytime Upgrade.  It’s broken now, but in the future it will handle Windows 8 → Windows 8 Pro + Media Center <span class="caps">OR</span> Windows 8 Pro → Windows 8 Pro + Media Center.  Media Center will also allow <span class="caps">DVD</span> playback, <strong><span class="caps">NOT</span> <span class="caps">POSSIBLE</span> <span class="caps">BY</span>&nbsp;<span class="caps">DEFAULT</span>.</strong></p>
<p>And please welcome <strong>The new Windows Update icon!</strong>  Seriously, Microsoft, decide.  All the three iterations of Windows 8 had a different one.  <span class="caps">DP</span> had the old one, <span class="caps">CP</span> had one without a Windows logo, <span class="caps">RP</span> has yet another one.

        <figcaption>Control Panel: Windows Update’s new icon.</figcaption>
</figure></p>
<p><strong>Family Safety.</strong>  Or: Parental Controls.  Now for weird human-like colorful <span class="caps">WLM</span> icons.  This <span class="caps">OS</span> is not made for&nbsp;humans!</p>
<p><strong>Language.</strong>  I see all my <span class="caps">CP</span> languages.  But can’t get a languge pack for German.  Why didn’t they make it available if I can download the <span class="caps">ISO</span> file <span class="caps">WITH</span> <span class="caps">GERMAN</span>?  Another change is that <span class="caps">UK</span> English displays “A language pack isn’t available.”  Yup, the Brits are gonna get their language in Windows.  I, for one, don’t think it would be of use, but some Brits apparently don’t like col<em>or</em>ful fav<em>or</em>ites in the cent<em>er</em> of this piece of shi<em>t.</em></p>

<p>This thing is gonna have five editions.  But you can’t get exactly all of&nbsp;them.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Windows 8.</strong>  The standard version.  Nothing&nbsp;specific.</li>
<li><strong>Windows 8 Pro.</strong>  With some more advanced features.&nbsp;Meh.</li>
<li><strong>Windows 8 Pro + Media Center.</strong>  In order to play DVDs or use Media Center, you will need to pay.  And if you bought regular Windows 8, you need to upgrade to Pro+<span class="caps">WMC</span> to use <span class="caps">WMC</span> capabilities.  But if you only want the “advanced” features of Pro, you need to pay for the Media Center.  No way to skip&nbsp;that.</li>
<li><strong>Windows 8 Enterprise.</strong>  Obvious, expensive, can’t get your hands on&nbsp;it.</li>
<li><strong>Windows <span class="caps">RT</span>.</strong>  <span class="caps">WHAT</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">FUCK</span> <span class="caps">IS</span> <span class="caps">THIS</span>, may you ask?  The answer is easy.  <span class="caps">ARM</span> version of Windows 8.  Without any desktop apps, except Office (free with your <span class="caps">DEVICE</span> with <span class="caps">RT</span>, as you <em>can’t buy this in&nbsp;stores.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>You can test the Pro + Media Center version now.  Sure, we’ll do that.  Entering the key provided by Microsoft, it works.  Reboot.  Adding features in logonui.  Reboot.  Long wait.  Preparing to configure Windows.  And I finally get my lock screen.  And a <span class="caps">WMC</span> icon appeared at the end of my Start screen.  I click on it and I am informed that I’m all done and my <span class="caps">PC</span> is ready to go.  Well, I should see that message <span class="caps">AFTER</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">BOOT</span>, not when I start the Desktop app.  Very bad&nbsp;design.</p>
<p>Another thing is that my desktop now says “Windows 8 Release Preview <strong>with Media Center</strong>”.  And that it started to lag when I started <span class="caps">WMC</span>.  And <span class="caps">WMC</span> is the <span class="caps">EXACT</span> <span class="caps">SAME</span> <span class="caps">THING</span> as in Windows 7 Home Premium, the one included <span class="caps">FOR</span> <span class="caps">FREE</span>.  Waste of&nbsp;money.</p>
<h2>Languages</h2>
<p>Dropping this bit.  Basically, I had some weird fun with my system locale and also showcased a bit of German in&nbsp;<span class="caps">CP</span>.</p>
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>One day, VirtualBox Guest Additions told me that there is an update for them.  Sure, I do want an update.  Installing, installing, and <span class="caps">OH</span> <span class="caps">SHIT</span> <span class="caps">IT</span> <span class="caps">FUCKED</span> <span class="caps">MY</span> <span class="caps">SYSTEM</span> <span class="caps">UP</span>.  I got a black screen.  Ctrl-Alt-Del changes the color to the fancy #004050 used by the whole Metro stuff as its background, but can’t see anything displayed.  So I asked the <span class="caps">CD</span> for help.  I noticed that it is a great way to test Refresh and Reset the <span class="caps">PC</span> features of Windows 8.  It would be a great way, but <span class="caps">BOTH</span> <span class="caps">OF</span> <span class="caps">THEM</span> <span class="caps">FAILED</span>.  Refresh worked for 15 minutes and did nothing.  Restart finished doing nothing instantly.  So I chose Advanced options.  I saw System Restore here.  System Restore is a tool included since Windows <span class="caps">ME</span>, year 2000.  <span class="caps">IT</span> <span class="caps">WORKED</span> <span class="caps">PERFECTLY</span>.  The only thing that was weird after the first reboot is my system language, as Metro went&nbsp;German.</p>
<p>And if we’re talking about Windows <span class="caps">ME</span>, it loved squares and blockiness.  It was a failure, loved to crash, had no <span class="caps">DOS</span> mode, replaced by <span class="caps">XP</span> after less than a year.  Replace <em><span class="caps">XP</span></em> with <em>9</em> and <em>no <span class="caps">DOS</span> mode</em> with <em>Explorer desktop with less meaning than ever before</em> and you have <strong>my future prediction for Windows 8</strong>.</p>
<h1>Summary and&nbsp;additions</h1>
<p>This thing is not great.  Metro and Desktop don’t work great together.  Microsoft tries to fix that by creating the new visual style, rensembling Office <span class="caps">XP</span>, with a more Metro-ish and blocky feeling, but <span class="caps">IT</span> <span class="caps">SUCKS</span>.  Dropping the Start button makes it even harder to use.  Sure, there are some new great features, like the Task Manager or the awesome multi-monitor support, but Metro makes it all&nbsp;worse.</p>
<p>I also couldn’t put my computer to sleep, nor hibernate it.  There is no such feature in Windows 8, at least under VirtualBox.  I have no data whether it is available on an actual <span class="caps">PC</span> right now, but I will fix that&nbsp;soon.</p>
<p>After installing <span class="caps">WMC</span>, Windows Media Player used my <span class="caps">PC</span> too much.  Over 90%, sometimes even&nbsp;95%.</p>
<p>I also had a better idea: upload something to my SkyDrive.  I couldn’t create a new directory in the SkyDrive app.  Are you&nbsp;serious?</p>
<p>This concludes my review of Windows 8 Release Preview.  Nice.  I suggest looking at the&nbsp;gallery.</p>
