CSS build instructions
======================

1. Make sure `bootstrap/scss/bootstrap.min.scss` is reachable from CWD. (Use
   a git clone or the downloadable distribution.)
2. Run `./update-bootstrap.sh`.
3. Quietly weep over the state of web development and be grateful that you
   didn’t actually need 300MB worth of `node_modules` to build this.
