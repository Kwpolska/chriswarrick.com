</figure><p>As I said at the end of the lo­go rant, I re­viewed Win­dows 8.  The third part of the &lt;del&gt;Twi­light&lt;/del&gt; Win­dows 8 saga, and the big­gest one.  I am go­ing to post more stuff about it in the fu­ture, but here it is: the Kw­pol­s­ka Win­dows 8 Con­sumer Pre­view Re­view.&nbsp;En­joy.</p>

</figure><p>Win­dows 8 was up at  <a class="reference external" href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/consumer-preview">Mi­crosoft­’s site</a>, so I got there.  I was of­fered an  <tt class="docutils literal">.exe</tt>.  I ran it and I got the Up­grade Ad­vi­sor from Win­dows 7, on­ly mod­i­fied.  It start­ed with a splash screen with the ter­ri­ble new  <a class="reference external" href="http://kwpolska.tk/blog/2012/02/25/new-windows-logo-yet-another-stupid-idea/">lo­go</a>, and then I got the Set­up win­dow.  Fun (not so) fac­t: it used the Win­dows Up­date icon, on­ly with­out the lo­go.  Then, I got my prod­uct key.  It was not the end of the fun: it wished to down­load it on its own, fol­lowed by up­dates.  Nor­mal­ly, I’d get an­gry and throw it out of the win­dow (read: kill the app and de­stroy the file), but I promised to do a re­view here and I had to keep it.  Then, I no­ticed I could get an ISO.  Beau­ti­ful.  Why was­n’t the link a bit more vis­i­ble?  There we go, I don’t need the key I got, we can hap­pi­ly kill this piece of crap (and it did­n&#8217;t show me the progress on the taskbar but­ton, like Chrome would do), I’ll grab the  <a class="reference external" href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/iso">ISO</a>.</p>

</figure><p>I wiped my Win­dows 8 De­vel­op­er Pre­view VDI (I played with it for a while) and in­stalled the Con­sumer Pre­view.  The in­stall­er is the same as in Win­dows Vista and 7.  Well, not ex­act­ly.  The boot screen is a fish.  Then, you are greet­ed by the lan­guage se­lec­tion screen, fea­tur­ing the new lo­go.  The next screen (<em>In­stall now</em>) drops the ar­row icon be­fore the tex­t.  Hit­ting  <em>Re­pair your com­put­er</em>  ac­ti­vates a new screen (Metro-ish).  But we’ll con­tin­ue with the ac­tu­al in­stal­la­tion process.  I get a screen ask­ing for the prod­uct key.  I type my key us­ing the vir­tu­al key­board (pic­tured, it works nice­ly) and con­tin­ued.  Then, I got the stan­dard step­s: li­cense agree­ment and disk par­ti­tion­ing.  The in­stall­er start­ed its work.  And, be­fore you ask: the Win­dows lo­go in the set­up pro­gram’s ti­tle bar has been re­placed by the Win­dows Up­date icon with­out a lo­go.  And the fake Aero bor­der is still the same style as&nbsp;Vis­ta/7.</p>

</figure><p>Win­dows 8 was suc­cess­ful­ly in­stalled.  Great.  It wants me to re­boot, so we’ll do that, this makes sense, as I am not aware of any OS which can move its en­vi­ron­ment from the CD to the HDD with­out one.  Then, I get greet­ed by the new boot screen (a­gain, a fish) and I get some more con­fig­ur­ing.  Prepar­ing, up­dat­ing the reg­istry set­tings, get­ting de­vices ready, get­ting sys­tem ready, re­boot­ing.  Okay, it may be need­ed, 7 did with­out it, but the ar­chi­tec­ture changed, so I’ll let it con­tin­ue.  Nex­t, I get a Metro set­up wiz­ard.  I get to name my PC (ac­cord­ing to my nam­ing schemes, this be­comes kw­pol­ska-egh) and to choose a col­or.  And no, I can’t say #00AADD nor #0000C1 (my stan­dard col­ors).  In­stead, I can “de­cide” be­tween: teal, char­coal, dark blue, pur­ple, plum, dark red, brown, green, light gray. They are not stan­dard col­ors, in­stead some weird shades.  I chose the de­fault teal col­or.  Nex­t, I get to choose some oth­er set­tings, the ex­press set­tings pro­posed by Mi­cro­soft are okay, so I am go­ing to stay with them.  Nex­t, I need to sign in with Win­dows Live (there is al­so a link to cre­ate a lo­cal ac­coun­t).  A screen asks me to wait.  This screen is a bit dif­fer­en­t: it fea­tures dark­er bars at the top and the bot­tom of the screen.  It re­minds me of Win­dows XP’s lo­gin screen.  Nex­t, I get to type in my pass­word.  On the right side of the screen, there is an icon for dis­play­ing your pass­word in plain text (and there is a char­ac­ter lim­it of about 16 char­ac­ters — if this is a tech­ni­cal lim­i­ta­tion, Mi­cro­soft stores your pass­word in  <strong>plain text</strong>  or with  <strong>very poor en­cryp­tion</strong>.)   Cre­at­ing my ac­coun­t, and then, guess what hap­pen­s.  Au­to-login?  No.  Reg­u­lar lo­gin screen?  Nope, try again.   A re­boot?  Yes, you’re right.  Third re­boot in such a short while.  Come on Mi­crosoft!  You can do with­out it.  You did it three years ago, in Win­dows 7.  There was on­ly one re­boot be­fore I got to the desk­top in it.  But any­ways, I got some more Pre­par­ing of Win­dows (like once is not enough), and&nbsp;wel­come.</p>

<figcaption>The Start Screen (page 1/2)</figcaption>
</figure><p>I get the Start screen.  It is clear­ly tablet-ori­ent­ed.  But I have a bet­ter ques­tion: where can I man­age my set­tings?  Where can I change my screen res­o­lu­tion?  Is there no Con­trol Pan­el?  Don’t force me to get to Aero desk­top, this will be the last thing I do in this re­view.  I fi­nal­ly get here.  Can you guess how?  Chris War­rick → Change ac­count pic­ture.  WHAT THE FUCK?  Any­ways, let’s take a look at the set­tings.  Lock screen set­tings.  I get to choose any­thing as its wall­pa­per (in­clud­ing some pic­tures by Mi­crosoft) and some apps that run in the back­ground while the screen is locked to pro­vide no­ti­fi­ca­tions (e.g. new mail no­ti­fi­ca­tion­s).  Start screen set­tings.  I get to choose from pre­de­fined tex­tures as the wall­pa­per and the same col­ors as be­fore (no cus­tomiza­tion at al­l).  Ac­count pic­ture should be ob­vi­ous.  Then, User­s.  Ex­cept for the pic­ture pass­word, noth­ing spe­cif­ic.  I set my pic­ture pass­word to  <em>three taps on the Turn off your PC but­ton in the Trou­bleshoot­ing menu in the set­up</em>  (the set­up pic­tures were al­ready up­load­ed to my Sky­Drive.)  No­ti­fi­ca­tion­s, Search, Share, all ob­vi­ous.  Gen­er­al, or rather  <em>stuff that did­n’t fit any­where else</em>, is the time set­tings (of course, the time zone set­tings are wrong), app switch­ing, spelling, lan­guage set­tings (a link to Aero Desk­top’s Con­trol Pan­el!) and PC re­fresh­ing/re­set­ting.  Re­fresh is a new idea, which is re­mov­ing all the app­s, but keep­ing your per­son­al da­ta.  Re­set will put Win­dows to a con­di­tion close to a brand new in­stal­l.  That may be use­ful for some peo­ple, ac­tu­al­ly.  The last  <em>Gen­er­al</em>  thing is  <em>Ad­vanced start­up</em>, which is close to hit­ting F8 on the boot man­ag­er of old­er Win­dows ver­sions (and some­times pray­ing for it to bring the menu up­), on­ly with a few more op­tion­s.  Pri­va­cy, De­vices, Ease of Ac­cess, Sync your Set­tings, Home­Group, Win­dows Up­date.  Ob­vi­ous, on­ly a side note for Win­dows Up­date: if you want to choose which up­dates you want to in­stal­l, you need to  <strong>switch to Aero Desk­top’s Con­trol Pan­el.</strong>   Yes, some­thing that easy ap­par­ent­ly re­quires a win­dow.  It found 5 up­dates on March 2nd, so I in­stalled them and I pro­ceed­ed fur­ther.  I was­n’t able to change my res­o­lu­tion (even though I won’t do that, be­cause I want to have all the screen­shots in the same&nbsp;size).</p>

<h2>Apps, Apps,&nbsp;Apps!</h2>

<figcaption>Store app.</figcaption>
</figure><p>Back to the Start screen.  Let’s be­gin with the  <strong>Store.</strong>   Since last time, it got a  <em>4</em>  in the bot­tom right cor­ner.  We ven­ture fur­ther.  The four meant four up­dates (ob­vi­ous­ly).  I in­stalled Cut the Rope, just for get­ting to know the process.  (hin­t: it’s slow as hel­l).  I al­so in­stalled the up­dates (and you can se­lect which up­dates you want to in­stal­l!).  1 app down, 19 left (I won’t show­case Cut the Rope and don’t count Desk­top and Win­dows Ex­plor­er as app­s, as this sec­tion deals on­ly with Metro&nbsp;app­s).</p> 
 <p>Up nex­t,  <strong>Xbox LIVE Games.</strong>   Just some news, games and achieve­ments, noth­ing spe­cif­ic.  Well, ex­cept for the fact that my avatar looks like&nbsp;shit.</p> 
 <p><strong>Map­s.</strong>   The search func­tion fails mis­er­ably, but di­rec­tions work.  Once again, the map looks like&nbsp;shit.</p> 
 <p><strong>In­ter­net Ex­plor­er 10, Metro edi­tion.</strong>  I am ac­tu­al­ly us­ing this app since a while (writ­ing this very blog post, in Word Web Ap­p, on my Sky­Drive, with mixed Mark­down-Of­fice for­mat­ting, as you can see on the screen­shot).  There is on­ly one prob­lem: it does not work well.  There are bare­ly any in­struc­tion­s.  I don’t know what to do when I need to search the We­b.  I work us­ing the key­board short­cut­s, but that is not easy.  There is no help for ver­sion 10 what­so­ev­er.  Am I be­ing forced to in­clude the S-­word at the end of al­most ev­ery&nbsp;re­view?</p> 
 <p>Oh, and time for a last-minute dis­cov­ery.  There is an­oth­er way to get to the set­tings.  Press Win­dows+C or put the mouse in the top right cor­ner of your screen.  Hit Set­tings and click  <em>More PC Set­tings</em>.   <strong>HOW IS SOME­ONE SUP­POSED TO KNOW ABOUT THAT?!</strong>  One more thing: this brings up a menu for the app you are us­ing now.  I’d use the ob­vi­ous word, but I don’t want&nbsp;to.</p> 
 <p>Take a screen­shot of IE (in a very weird way), and let’s con­tin­ue.  I’d go with  <strong>Video</strong>.  You can watch some movies and TV shows (same as Xbox), and that’s all it can do.  I won’t show you a screen­shot, be­cause I’d get sued by copy­right own­er­s, but it’s sim­i­lar to Xbox LIVE&nbsp;Games.</p> 
 <p>You won’t get the Desk­top now, but I’ll give you  <strong>Pho­tos</strong>  in­stead.  Or I won’t, be­cause it’s ob­vi­ous: it dis­plays pho­tos (note: Sky­Drive is avail­able if you&nbsp;wait­).</p> 
 <p>What’s nex­t?   <strong>Mes­sag­ing.</strong>  Win­dows Live Mes­sen­ger + Face­book Chat.  Use­ful, but I won’t show­case any­thing&nbsp;spe­cif­ic.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mail.</strong>  It asked me for my Gmail pass­word.  It no­ticed that I am us­ing a Gmail ad­dress for my Live ac­count and want mail from here.  Cool.  It showed my mail­box.  It crashed when I tried to open some mails (like the GOG one, pic­tured), but oth­er­wise it can do its job good.  It will al­so show the un­read mail count on the Start screen tile.  Un­for­tu­nate­ly, it does­n’t sup­port con­ver­sa­tion view, and there­fore&nbsp;suck­s.</p> 
 <p>Let me in­ter­rupt with one more last minute dis­cov­ery in IE 10: it shows a tab bar when you press the right mouse but­ton.  The on­ly prob­lem is: Word Web App steals it.  I dis­cov­ered it while I was sav­ing the doc­u­men­t, which took&nbsp;ages.</p> 
 <p><strong>Weath­er.</strong>  I fire it up and — whoah. — It wants to en­able lo­ca­tion ser­vices and lo­cate me.  I say no, even though it would fail no mat­ter what.  It looks kind of nice, but it does­n’t al­low hu­man tem­per­a­ture units (de­grees&nbsp;Cel­sius).</p> 
 <p><strong>Cal­en­dar.</strong>  I see my Google cal­en­dar events.  Yeah, you’ve guessed it: it us­es the same de­tails as Mail.  It dis­plays my events on the tile and the lock screen.  It works okay, ex­cept I need to sync my events in the Mail&nbsp;ap­p.</p> 
 <p><strong>Peo­ple.</strong>  Sim­i­lar to Peo­ple on Win­dows Phone 7, it dis­plays all the peo­ple I have in my con­tacts or friends from all over the we­b.  It presents peo­ple from my Gmail/An­droid con­tacts&nbsp;list.</p> 
 <p><strong>Games: Pin­ball FX and Soli­taire.</strong>  Just games.  And soli­taire of­fers me to log in­to Xbox LIVE.  And dis­plays Vis­it ES­R­B.­com for rat­ing in­for­ma­tion.  Now it is a ful­l-­class game!  (and I did­n’t even both­er with the oth­er&nbsp;game.)</p> 
 <p><strong>Cam­er­a.</strong>  Does­n’t work on a PC, at least if you don’t have a we­b­cam.  Use­less for&nbsp;me.</p> 
 <p><strong>Xbox Com­pan­ion.</strong>  Like I did­n’t have enough Xbox app­s.  And it is use­less be­cause I don’t own an&nbsp;Xbox.</p> 
 <p><strong>Mu­sic.</strong>   Same thing as Videos, on­ly for&nbsp;mu­sic.</p> 
 <p><strong>Sky­Drive.</strong>   This is a desk­top client for Sky­Drive.  It is re­al­ly nice and use­ful.  I hope to get one for Win­dows 7&nbsp;soon.</p> 
 <p><strong>Re­mote Desk­top.</strong>  Don’t have a place to con­nect to (Win­dows 7 Home Pre­mi­um has no Re­mote Desk­top Server), so it’s&nbsp;use­less.</p> 
 <p><strong>Fi­nance.</strong>  Or: Bing Fi­nance news.  Thus,&nbsp;use­less.</p> 
 <p><strong>Read­er.</strong>  It reads PDFs and XPF­s.  Yes, it sup­ports PDF­s.  Fi­nal­ly Win­dows has sup­port for&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Just for the sake of it, I cre­at­ed a new ac­coun­t.  I looked at it and then want­ed to get rid of it.  Good news: you can’t do this in Metro.  You need to switch to the Aero desk­top.  (I did this&nbsp;lat­er.)</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>But wait, there’s more: a glob­al com­men­t. Even though most of the apps I re­viewed worked nice­ly, they felt made specif­i­cal­ly for tablets and not reg­u­lar com­put­er­s.  Ev­ery­thing was gi­ant.  My mouse made a lot of move­ments.  Many things were hid­den in the right-click “menus” (sim­i­lar to the An­droid hard­ware Menu but­ton).  This is not nice.  It was not the best ex­pe­ri­ence.  It would work nice­ly on a tablet, but Metro (stil­l) sucks on reg­u­lar (mouse + key­board)&nbsp;hard­ware.</p> 
 <p>But will I ev­er need to use Metro if I would switch to Win­dows 8 (not very like­ly, as I bought a Win­dows 7 li­cense a while ago)?  I don’t think so.  I have most of my apps I use of­ten pinned to the taskbar in Win­dows 7.  Out of them, on­ly one is Metro-ized al­ready (Sky­Drive, in 7 as a pinned IE9 ap­p).  Up to one app has a chance of hav­ing a Metro ver­sion: Google Chrome (note: Chrome is my base browser, and IE9 is used  <em>on­ly</em>  for Sky­Drive.  The Start menu re­veals one more: Win­dows Live Mail (the Mail app re­viewed&nbsp;above).</p> 
 <p>Metro is writ­ten  <em>specif­i­cal­ly</em>  for tablet­s.  Press­ing the right mouse but­ton to bring up a tool­bar is stupid.  This is NOT how a reg­u­lar us­er would work.  Same goes for the new lock&nbsp;screen.</p> 
 <p>I al­so rat­ed ev­ery ap­p.  The rat­ings will be post­ed at the end, but now, I’ll share with you that (a) the Metro UI it­self got a 3 out of 10, and (b) the Metro apps av­er­age for 5.  The high­est rat­ing is 10 (Soli­taire) and the low­est is 0 (all the apps called  <em>use­less</em>: Cam­er­a, Xbox Com­pan­ion, Fi­nance and Re­mote&nbsp;Desk­top).</p> 
 <p>My opin­ions are rather neg­a­tive, I don’t like the new Metro UI, I used a swear word 3 times and cen­sored my­self&nbsp;twice.</p>

</figure><p>I left this one for the very end.  I even de­cid­ed to do this the next day!  First things first, I synced my re­view da­ta be­tween my PC and my Sky­Drive, and then fired up the VM.  Time to click the  <strong>Desk­top</strong>  tile.  So I hit it&nbsp;and</p> 
 <strong style="font-size: 3em;">START IS GONE! WHAT THE FUCK?!</strong><p>Yes.  There is  <strong>no Start but­ton</strong>  in Win­dows 8.  It’s gone for­ev­er.  When you hov­er the bot­tom left cor­ner, a thing ap­pears, show­ing your Start screen.  Ap­par­ent­ly, hit­ting this thing will bring the Start screen up.  And, if you right-click in the cor­ner (found this while try­ing to do any­thing with that thing), you get a menu with some ba­sic op­tion­s.  This brings down the rat­ing of the Desk­top com­po­nent of Win­dows Ex­plor­er to 1 out of&nbsp;10.</p> 
 <p>But then I fire up the  <strong>File Man­ag­er com­po­nent of Win­dows Ex­plor­er.</strong>   And I am greet­ed by a Rib­bon.  I ex­pressed my opin­ion about it in my first post about Win­dows 8, so I’ll quote&nbsp;my­self:</p> 
 <p>&gt;  <strong>Rib­bon.</strong>  This has to be the dumb­est idea ev­er. It looks like on­ly 10.9% of com­mands in Ex­plor­er come from the tool­bar (or the “com­mand bar”, as called by Steven Sinof­sky in the blog post). They al­so show that, out of the top 10 com­mands used in Ex­plor­er, on­ly two of them are in the tool­bar. How would you fix this prob­lem? Ei­ther add the com­mands or just ig­nore it. But what did Mi­cro­soft do? Add a rib­bon and put a lot of stuff [on it]. Se­ri­ous­ly? This does­n’t fix the prob­lem. Peo­ple will still work with the con­text menu and hotkeys. On the plus side, you get two more items in the di­rec­to­ry view. Yay! There are al­so key­board short­cuts for all the rib­bon el­e­ments, but they are in­putted in a crazy way. 1/10. Yeah, it’s that&nbsp;bad.</p> 
 <p>But we’ll ig­nore the 1/10 for a while.  The oth­er things new Ex­plor­er brings are mount­ing VHDs and ISOs and bet­ter file copy­ing.  Do like.  How about a&nbsp;3/10?</p> 
 <p>Wait for a while.  Is that a new win­dow bor­der?  It is.  And it sucks bad­ly.  It lost all of its glass ef­fect­s, and the but­tons are worse.  Ev­ery­thing is square.  It is even worse in the ba­sic theme.  And the vis­ual hint for Show Desk­top (the rec­tan­gle on the right of 7’s taskbar) is&nbsp;gone.</p>

<figcaption>All the apps in Windows 8 (and Cut The Rope).</figcaption>
</figure><p>Back to look­ing through the app­s, even though there is not much to do.  First of, in or­der to get to your desk­top app­s, you need to get to the Metro start screen, hit the right menu but­ton in an emp­ty space, hit  <em>All apps</em>  on the tool­bar and there you go.  You can al­so type some­thing on the Start screen to search: you are able to search app­s, set­tings, files (it al­so search­es their con­tents) and Metro app­s.  Search can al­so be brought up through the Charms (right-­side tool­bar, Win­dows+C or mouse in top/bot­tom right cor­ner → mouse go­ing&nbsp;down/up).</p> 
 <p>I’ll be­gin with  <strong>In­ter­net Ex­plor­er 10, Aero Desk­top edi­tion</strong>, as (a) it is pinned on the taskbar; and (b) I am us­ing Word Web App to write this re­view.  There is on­ly one dif­fer­ence in the UI: the scroll­bars are Metro-ish (they aren’t changed in oth­er Aero app­s).  The en­gine may be dif­fer­en­t, but I did­n’t no­tice any oth­er changes while&nbsp;brows­ing.</p> 
 <p>Up nex­t:  <strong>Win­dows De­fend­er.</strong>  The name is mis­lead­ing, be­cause it is Mi­cro­soft Se­cu­ri­ty Es­sen­tials with a dif­fer­ent name and in­te­grat­ed in­to Win­dows.  And I like MSE, it is my AV on Win­dows&nbsp;7.</p> 
 <p>I am not go­ing to re­view the apps that haven’t been mod­i­fied, and the on­ly ones that were are On-Screen Key­board and Task&nbsp;Man­ag­er.</p> 
 <p><strong>On-Screen Key­board.</strong>  It looks more like a Metro ap­p, it has a Fade op­tion, and it still can pre­dict&nbsp;in­put.</p> 
 <p>By the way, the  <em>Tablet PC In­put Pan­el</em>  be­came  <em>Touch Key­board</em>.  It is re­al­ly&nbsp;nice.</p> 
 <p><strong>Task Man­ag­er.</strong>  Oh, this looks&nbsp;fa­mil­iar.</p>

<figcaption>The Control Panel. (glitched, Category view)</figcaption>
</figure><p>We al­so need to take a look at Con­trol Pan­el.  First thought­s: the icons are cor­rupt­ed due to its spe­cif­ic way of mak­ing the tool­bar trans­par­ent due to no rib­bon here, and when you fire it up from the Ex­plor­er, the tool­bar is black (and the icons are okay).  Win­dows Up­date’s icon is back to nor­mal.  You can see a few new fea­tures: Stor­age Spaces, which let you do mag­ic with HDDs (think: RAID), and a spe­cif­ic Lan­guage pan­el.  But let’s take a clos­er&nbsp;look.</p> 
 <p><strong>Lan­guage.</strong>  MUIs fi­nal­ly stop be­ing a mess: Ev­ery us­er can have his own lan­guage, they aren’t in Win­dows Up­date any­more, and are not hid­den some­where in Re­gion­al set­tings.  Cur­rent­ly, you can­not get the lan­guage packs (even though the ISOs are avail­able in a few lan­guages (cre­at­ing the lan­guage pack should­n’t be prob­lem­at­ic, as it just puts  <cite>.mui</cite>  files in C:Win­dows[lan­guage­code] and oth­er places like that), but this op­tion can al­so in­stall new key­board lay­outs as well.  Good news for the Brit­s: your very favourite lan­guage is on the way to this bloody&nbsp;thing!</p>

<a href="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/w8cp/img/ss095.png" title="Storage Spaces: A configured Storage Space.

<figcaption>Storage Spaces: A configured Storage Space.  Also displaying a <em>New drive detected</em> Metro-style notification asking me to <strong>tap</strong> it.</figcaption>
</figure><p><strong>Stor­age Spa­ces.</strong>  It’s some­thing like RAID, on­ly pro­pri­etary.  It does it work nice­ly: it can mir­ror your drives, and you can have more log­i­cal space on your drives.  I al­so used it to show­case the new copy di­a­log and the new stor­age no­ti­fi­ca­tion, which asks me to  <strong>tap</strong>  it­self.  If I would dis­con­nect the drive, or if it would fail (in a re­al ma­chine), my files would be still&nbsp;alive.</p> 
 <p><strong>Sys­tem.</strong>   The Sys­tem win­dow drops the Win­dows lo­go, and the Win­dows Ex­pe­ri­ence In­dex scale is in­creased: the up­per lim­it is now 9.9 (Vista had 5.9 and 7 had 7.9).  I get a 2.0 due to us­ing Vir­tu­al­Box.  Quite frankly, my HDD scored 5.9 in 7, but here it is 6.3.  As far as I know, if I ran 8 with­out vir­tu­al­iza­tion, I’d get the same scores as in 7.&nbsp;Weird.</p> 
 <p><strong>Taskbar.</strong>  They dropped the Start Menu part, they changed the icon, and got rid of the Start Menu tab.  It looks like we won’t see it&nbsp;any­more.</p> 
 <p><strong>Win­dows 7 File Re­cov­ery.</strong>  The name of this ap­plet is a bit weird, as it is Back­up and Re­store from Win­dows 7.  I tried to re­store my back­up from Win­dows 7 (from yes­ter­day 18:26 CET, they are sched­uled for 16:00 CET dai­ly), but it failed for some rea­son (maybe be­cause the com­put­er name is dif­fer­en­t?)  By the way: Win­dows Com­pressed Fold­ers (the de­fault .zip han­dler in Win­dows since 1998) are&nbsp;ter­ri­ble.</p> 
 <p>But I think I dis­cov­ered the rea­son for the weird name:  <strong>File His­to­ry</strong>, or, if you’d like, Ap­ple Time Ma­chine rip-of­f.  It al­lows me to re­store my Win­dows 8 files&nbsp;eas­i­ly.</p> 
 <p><strong>Us­er Ac­counts.</strong>  It would be too easy if this OS would­n’t make me an­gry to­day.  It of­fers me a link stat­ing  <em>Make changes to my ac­count in **PC set­tings**</em>.  PC set­tings is the thing that we saw in the  <em>What is go­ing on?</em>  chap­ter (in case you don’t know: this re­placed pass­word, us­er pic­ture and us­er name&nbsp;op­tion­s).</p>

<h2>Review&nbsp;Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Win­dows 8 apps got an av­er­age of 5.24.  But the whole OS would get a 2 out of 10 in terms of UX.  I had no fun while us­ing this sys­tem.  It felt like no­body used it with a mouse or&nbsp;key­board!</p>
