was MPD, the Music Player Daemon.
This is a short guide on how to do this.

<p>Recently, I had to reinstall Windows.  One of the things I had to set up
was MPD, the <a class="reference external" href="http://musicpd.org/">Music Player Daemon</a>.</p>
<p>This is a short guide on how to do this.</p>



<section id="step-1-get-mpd-and-mpc">
<h1>Step 1: get MPD and MPC</h1>
<p>Download <a class="reference external" href="http://musicpd.org/download/win32/">MPD</a> (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mpd-x.y.z-win32.zip</span></code>, replacing <code class="docutils literal">x.y.z</code> with whatever is the current available version of this file) and <a class="reference external" href="http://musicpd.org/download/mpc/">MPC</a> (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mpc-x.y-win32-zip</span></code>).  I suggest using
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">C:\mpd</span></code> as your base path.  This post assumes you actually used this
value.</p>
<p>Put everything from the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/mpd-x.y.z-win32/bin/</span></code> directory of the
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mpd-x.y.z-win32.zip</span></code> archive into your base path (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">C:\mpd</span></code>).  From
the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">mpc-x.y-win32.zip</span></code> archive, take <code class="docutils literal">mpc.exe</code> and
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">libmpdclient-2.dll</span></code> and put them there.</p>
</section>
<section id="step-1-5-optional-but-recommended-get-gmpc">
<h1>Step 1.5 (optional, but recommended): get GMPC</h1>
<p>If you want a nice, easy, graphical interface for MPD, you should install
GMPC, the <a class="reference external" href="http://gmpclient.org/">Gnome Music Player Client</a>.  The installation is very
straightforward, so I’ll leave the details out.</p>
</section>
<section id="step-2-create-a-config-file">
<h1>Step 2: create a config file</h1>
<p>You need to create a configuration file.  A sample one is included in
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">/mpd-x.y.z-win32/doc/mpdconf.sample</span></code>.  Use the <code class="docutils literal">winmm</code> output type.</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Windows Notepad will not work, because it does not understand
Unix-style line endings (<code class="docutils literal">\n</code> instead of <code class="docutils literal">\r\n</code>).</p>
<p>For <code class="docutils literal">db_file</code> and <code class="docutils literal">log_file</code>, I recommend a file in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">C:\mpd\data\</span></code>.
I also recommend saving your config as <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">C:\mpd\data\mpd.conf</span></code> (in fact,
this is yet another assumption we make in this guide)</p>
<section id="multi-boot-corner-keep-parts-of-the-config-the-same">
<h2>Multi Boot Corner: keep parts of the config the same</h2>
<p>Because I have a dual-boot system, there are some directions for
multi-boot users.</p>
<p>Your <code class="docutils literal">music_directory</code>, <code class="docutils literal">playlist_directory</code> and <code class="docutils literal">state_file</code> <em>must</em> be the same on all the systems in your multi-boot environment.  It is recommended to use the same <code class="docutils literal">db_file</code>.</p>
<p>Your audio outputs must have the same names.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="step-3-test-your-configuration">
<h1>Step 3: test your configuration</h1>
<p>Open up two Command Prompt windows.  In the first one, run:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">cd C:\mpd
mpd data\mpd.conf</pre>
<p>If you see this message:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">Failed to load database: Failed to open database file &quot;&lt;name&gt;&quot;: No such file or directory</pre>
<p>then you can ignore it.  If you see another message, fix whatever it
states.  You may also use <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--stdout</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-v</span></code> to get more output
messages.</p>
<section id="multi-boot-path">
<h2>Multi Boot path</h2>
<p>If you followed the Multi Boot instructions correctly, you might be
hearing music already.  If you do not, use your other Command Prompt window and
run:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">cd C:\mpd
mpc play</pre>
<p>If it outputs the name of a song, a <code class="docutils literal">[playing]</code> line, all is well (if you
cannot hear music, unmute your audio).</p>
<p>If you do not have a mpd database yet, use the <em>Single path</em>.</p>
<p><strong>If MPD works, press Ctrl+C in the window where you ran ``mpd
datampd.conf.``</strong></p>
</section>
<section id="single-path">
<h2>Single path</h2>
<p>In the other Command Prompt window, run:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">cd C:\mpd
mpc update
mpc add &quot;FILENAME&quot;
mpc play</pre>
<p>(FILENAME should be a name of a file in your music library.  Make sure to
keep the quotes.)</p>
<p>And now you should hear music.  If you do not, try to unmute, then read
the output of <code class="docutils literal">mpc</code> and try to fix it.</p>
<p><strong>If MPD works, press Ctrl+C in the window where you ran ``mpd
datampd.conf.``</strong></p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="step-3-5-test-gmpc">
<h1>Step 3.5: test GMPC</h1>
<p>Start the Gnome Music Player Client.  Click <em>Forward</em>, <em>Connect</em>,
<em>Forward</em>, <em>Close</em> and all should be well.</p>
</section>
<section id="step-4-create-a-windows-service">
<h1>Step 4: create a Windows service</h1>
<p>In order to run the daemon in the <em>daemon</em> mode, i.e. hidden, you need to
perform some extra steps.  You cannot use Startup in the Start Menu, you
also cannot use the Run registry keys (this results in an ugly Command Prompt
window running all the time that you cannot close or hide in the tray).</p>
<p>How to solve this problem?  Just run it as a Windows service.  That is
very easy to do.</p>
<p>Open a Command Prompt window as an administrator (right-click on <em>Command
Prompt</em> in the Start Menu/on the Start Screen and choose <em>Run as administrator</em>).</p>
<p>In that window, run one very easy command (make sure to copy-paste this
exactly!):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">sc create mpd binPath= &quot;c:\mpd\mpd.exe c:\mpd\data\mpd.conf&quot;</pre>
<p>If it said:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal">[SC] CreateService SUCCESS</code>, congratulations — you are almost done!  Skip down to <em>Service configuration.</em></p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal">[SC] OpenSCManager FAILED 5: Access is denied.</code>, you need an
<strong>Administrator</strong> Command Prompt.</p></li>
<li><p>something else, check your spelling or Google the error.</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="service-configuration">
<h2>Service configuration</h2>
<p>That is the easiest part of this guide.</p>
<p>Start the <em>Services</em> console.  You can get to it by typing
<code class="docutils literal">services.msc</code> into the Start Menu/Screen search (<em>Run</em> for XP or
older).</p>
<p>In the tool, find the <code class="docutils literal">mpd</code> service.  Go to the <em>Log On</em> tab, choose
<em>This account:</em> and enter your credentials there.  Hit <em>Apply</em> and go to
the <em>General</em> tab, on which you should choose the <em>Startup type</em> to be
<em>Automatic (Delayed Start)</em>.  Finish by pressing <em>Start</em>.  MPD should be
running and configured properly.  You can now hit <em>OK</em> and close the
<em>Services</em> window, along with the command prompts you have open.</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> if you change your Windows password, you need to change your
password in the <em>Services</em> console as well!</p>
</section>
<section id="just-in-case-uninstalling-the-service">
<h2>Just in case: uninstalling the service</h2>
<p>First off, stop the service (in the Services console or through <code class="docutils literal">sc stop
mpd</code> in an administrator command prompt).</p>
<p>Then, run <code class="docutils literal">sc delete mpd</code>.</p>
