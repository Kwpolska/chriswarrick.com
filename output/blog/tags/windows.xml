Microsoft sold &lt;strong&gt;40,000,000&lt;/strong&gt; licenses of Microsoft Windows.  That is a little
bit above, hmm, nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.windows.com/windows/b/bloggingwindows/archive/2012/11/27/windows-8-40-million-licenses-sold.aspx"&gt;Obligatory Microsoft link&lt;/a&gt;.  But, oh wait, there is one important word:
&lt;em&gt;licenses&lt;/em&gt;.  So, when [insert favorite OEM here] called Microsoft and said he
wants eg. 10000 OEM licenses for his new PCs.  The counter goes up by 10000 the
moment &lt;em&gt;Microsoft&lt;/em&gt; gets their money for the license, and not when the OEM gets
their money for a sold machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have sorted out the OEM thing.  But how does this number relate to
BOX/Upgrade purchases?  Activations or shipments?  That is also important.  And
that is how you go from 10 million to 40 million. without actually selling that
many copies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, let’s talk a bit about the NPD.  And I mean the US market reasearcher
and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/press-releases/windows-8-gets-off-to-a-slow-start-according-to-the-npd-group/"&gt;what they wrote about Windows 8&lt;/a&gt;. What did they write, may you ask?  8
(and PCs themselves) did not do well.  Great news for sane people!
Unfortunately, it was just one month.  Including Black Friday, though.  And I
hope Windows 8 will die horribly.  And quickly.  Same goes for Microsoft.
Because people do not want Modern UI (aka Metro).  And Windows tablets.  Now go
buy an iPad.  Or a Mac.  Or both.  Or a Windows 7 PC.  Or a clean PC on which
you can install Linux, and preferrably a good distro of it.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>windows</category><category>win8</category><category>rant</category><category>review</category><guid>http://kwpolska.tk/blog/2012/12/02/forty-million-is-nothing/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 02 Dec 2012 17:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
