Here’s a list of things that might be useful to keep in mind before, during, and after a migration of a server that hosts publicly accessible Web sites and applications, as well as other personal services, and how to get rid of the most annoying parts of Ubuntu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why switch?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fedora is a relatively popular distro, so it’s well supported by software vendors. Its packagers adopt a no-nonsense approach, making very little changes that deviate from the upstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu is not my favorite distro, far from it. While it is perhaps the most popular distro out there, its packages contain many more patches compared to Fedora, and Canonical (the company behind Ubuntu) are famous for betting on the wrong horse (Unity, upstart, Mir…). But one thing Ubuntu does well is stability. Fedora makes releases every 6 months, and those releases are supported for just 13 months, which means upgrading at least every year. Every upgrade may introduce incompatibilities, almost every upgrade requires recreating Python venvs. That gets boring fast, and it does not necessarily bring benefits. Granted, the Fedora system upgrade works quite well, and I upgraded through at least eight releases without a re-install, but I would still prefer to avoid it. That’s why I went with Ubuntu LTS, which is supported for five years, with a new release every two years, but which still comes with reasonably new software (and with many third-party repositories if something is missing or outdated).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Test your backups&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a backup “system” that’s a bunch of Bash scripts. After upgrading one of the services that is being backed up, the responsible script started crashing, and thus backups stopped working. Another thing that broke was e-mails from cron, so I didn’t know anything was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I do have full disk backups enabled at &lt;a href="https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=Qy1lehF8PwzP"&gt;Hetzner&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(disclaimer: referral link)&lt;/em&gt;, my custom backups are more fine-grained (e.g. important configuration files, database dumps, package lists), so they are quite useful in migrating between OSes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here’s a reminder not only to test your backups regularly, but also to make sure they are being created at all, and to make sure cron can send you logs somewhere you can see them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonus cron tip: set &lt;code&gt;MAILFROM=&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;MAILTO=&lt;/code&gt; in your crontab if your SMTP server does not like the values cron uses by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think about IP address reassignment (or pray to the DNS gods)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new VPS or cloud server probably means a new IP address. But if you get a new IP address, that might complicate the migration of your publicly accessible applications. If you’re proxying all your Web properties through Cloudflare or something similar, that’s probably not an issue. But if you have a raw A record somewhere, things can get complicated. DNS servers and operating systems do a lot of caching. The conventional wisdom is to wait 24 or even 48 hours after changing DNS values. This might be true if your TTL is set to a long value, but if your TTL is short, the only worry are DNS servers that ignore TTL values and cache records for longer. If you plan a migration, it’s good to check your TTL well in advance, and not worry too much about broken DNS servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you might not need a new IP. Carefully review your cloud provider’s IP management options before making any changes. Hetzner is more flexible than other hosts in this regard, as it is possible to &lt;a href="https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/servers/primary-ips/faq"&gt;move primary public IP addresses (not “floating” or “elastic” IPs) between servers&lt;/a&gt;, as long as you’re okay with a few minutes’ downtime (you will need to shut down the source and destination servers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re not okay with any downtime, you would probably want to leverage the floating/elastic IP feature, or hope DNS propagates quickly enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trim the fat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My VPS ran a lot of services I don’t need anymore, but never really got around to decommissioning. For example, I had a full Xfce install with VNC access (the VNC server was only running when needed). I haven’t actually used the desktop for ages, so I just dropped it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also had an OpenVPN setup. It was useful years ago, when mobile data allowances were much smaller and speeds much worse. These days, I don’t use public WiFi networks at all, unless I’m going abroad, and I just buy one month of &lt;a href="https://mullvad.net/"&gt;Mullvad VPN&lt;/a&gt; for €5 whenever that happens. So, add another service to the “do not migrate” list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that I could not just remove was the e-mail server. Many years ago, I ran a reasonably functional e-mail server on my VPS. I’ve since then migrated to &lt;a href="https://www.zoho.com/mail/"&gt;Zoho Mail&lt;/a&gt; (which costs €10.80/year), in part due to IP reputation issues after changing hosting providers, and also to avoid having to fight spam. When I did that, I kept Postfix around, but as a local server for things like cron or Django to send e-mail with, and I configured it to send all e-mails via Zoho. But I did not really want to move over all the configuration, hoping that Ubuntu’s Postfix packages can work with my hacked together config from Fedora. So I replaced the server with &lt;a href="https://www.opensmtpd.org/"&gt;OpenSMTPD&lt;/a&gt; (from the OpenBSD project), and all the Postfix configuration files with just one short configuration file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;table aliases file:/etc/aliases
table secrets file:/etc/mail-secrets

listen on localhost
listen on 172.17.0.1 # Docker

action "relay" relay host smtp+tls://smtp@smtp.example.net:587 auth &amp;lt;secrets&amp;gt; mail-from "@example.com"

match from any for any action "relay"
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Dockerize everything…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My server runs a few different apps, some of which are exposed on the public Internet, while some do useful work in the background. The services I have set up most recently are containerized with the help of Docker. The only Docker-based service that was stateful (and did not just use folders mounted as volumes) was a MariaDB database. Migrating that is straightforward with a simple dump-and-restore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, not everything on my server is in Docker. The public-facing nginx install isn’t, and neither is PostgreSQL (but that was also a quick dump-and-restore migration with some extra steps).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;…especially Python&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, there are the Python apps. Python the language is cool (if a little slow), but the packaging story is a &lt;a href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/"&gt;total&lt;/a&gt; dumpster &lt;a href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2024/01/15/python-packaging-one-year-later/"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, here’s a quick recap of 2024/2025 in Python packaging: the most hyped Python package manager (&lt;code&gt;uv&lt;/code&gt;) is written in Rust, which screams “Python is a toy language in which you can’t even write a tool as simple as a package manager”. (I know, dependency resolution is computationally expensive, so doing &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; in Rust makes sense, but everything else could easily be done in pure Python. And no, the package manager should not manage Python installs.) Of course, almost all the other contenders listed in my 2023 post are still being developed. On the standards front, the community finally produced a lockfile standard after years of discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I have three Python apps. One of them is &lt;a href="https://isso-comments.de/"&gt;Isso&lt;/a&gt;, which is providing the comments box below this post. I used to run a modified version of Isso a long time ago, but I don’t need to anymore. I looked at the docs, and they offer &lt;a href="https://isso-comments.de/docs/reference/installation/#using-docker"&gt;a pre-built Docker image&lt;/a&gt;, which means I could just quickly deploy it on my server with Docker and skip the pain of managing Python environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other two apps are Django projects built by yours truly. They are not containerized, they exist in venvs created using the system Python. Moving venvs between machines is generally impossible, so I had to re-create them. Of course, I hit a deprecation, because the Python maintainers (especially in the packaging world) does not understand their responsibility as maintainers of the most popular programming language. This time, it was caused by &lt;a href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11457"&gt;an old editable install with setuptools (using setup.py develop, not PEP 660)&lt;/a&gt;, and installs with more recent pip/setuptools versions would not have this error… although &lt;a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/do-we-want-to-keep-the-build-system-default-for-pyproject-toml/104759"&gt;some people want to remove the fallback to setuptools if there is no pyproject.toml&lt;/a&gt;, so you need to stay up to date with the whims of the Python packaging industry if you want to use Python software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Don’t bother with ufw&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu ships with &lt;code&gt;ufw&lt;/code&gt;, the “uncomplicated firewall”, in the default install. I was previously using &lt;code&gt;firewalld&lt;/code&gt;, a Red Hat-adjacent project, but I decided to give ufw a try. Since if it’s part of the default install, it might be supported better by the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that Docker and ufw &lt;a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/packet-filtering-firewalls/#docker-and-ufw"&gt;don’t play together&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://github.com/chaifeng/ufw-docker?tab=readme-ov-file#solving-ufw-and-docker-issues"&gt;Someone has built a set of rules that are supposed to fix it&lt;/a&gt;, but that did not work for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Docker &lt;a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/packet-filtering-firewalls/#integration-with-firewalld"&gt;does integrate with firewalld&lt;/a&gt;, and Ubuntu has packages for it, so I just installed it, enabled the services that need to be publicly available and things were working again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update (2025-11-23):&lt;/em&gt; The iptables integration was not very stable on my Ubuntu system, so I disabled the iptables integration and switched to &lt;a href="https://dev.to/soerenmetje/how-to-secure-a-docker-host-using-firewalld-2joo"&gt;a simpler config in firewalld only&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kill the ads (and other nonsense too)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red Hat makes money by selling a stable OS with at least 10 years of support to enterprises, and their free offering is Fedora, with just 13 months of support; RHEL releases are branched off from Fedora. SUSE also sells SUSE Linux Enterprise and has openSUSE as the free offering (but the relationship between the paid and free version is more complicated).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu chose a different monetization strategy: the enterprise offering is the same OS as the free offering, but it gets extra packages and extra updates. The free OS advertises the paid services. It is fairly simple to get rid of them all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;sudo apt autoremove ubuntu-pro-client
sudo chmod -x /etc/update-motd.d/*
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, Ubuntu installs snap by default. Snap is a terrible idea. Luckily, there are no snaps installed by default on a Server install, so we can just remove &lt;code&gt;snapd&lt;/code&gt;. We’ll also remove &lt;code&gt;lxd-installer&lt;/code&gt; to save ~25 kB of disk space, since the installer requires snap, and lxd is another unsuccessful Canonical project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;sudo apt autoremove snapd lxd-installer
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The cost of downgrading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going from Fedora 42 (April 2025) to Ubuntu 24.04 (April 2024) means some software will be downgraded in the process. In general, this does not matter, as most software does not mind downgrades as much. One notable exception is WeeChat, the IRC client, whose config files are versioned, and Ubuntu’s version is not compatible with the one in Fedora. But here’s where Ubuntu’s popularity shines: &lt;a href="https://weechat.org/download/debian/"&gt;WeeChat has its own repositories for Debian and Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;, so I could just get the latest version without building it myself or trying to steal packages from a newer version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than WeeChat, I haven’t experienced any other issues with software due to a downgrade. Some of it is luck (or not using new/advanced features), some of it is software caring about backwards compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was it worth it? Time will tell. Upgrading Fedora itself was not that hard, and I expect Ubuntu upgrades to be OK too — the annoying part was cleaning up and getting things to work after the upgrade, and the switch means I will have to do it only every 2-4 years instead of every 6-12 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The switchover took a few hours, especially since I didn’t have much up-to-date documentation of what is actually installed and running, and there are always the minor details where distros differ that may require adjusting to. I think a migration like this is worth trying if rolling-release or frequently-released distros are too unstable for your needs.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>Django</category><category>Docker</category><category>Fedora</category><category>Linux</category><category>Python</category><category>Ubuntu</category><guid>https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2025/11/09/distro-hopping-server-edition/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 09 Nov 2025 18:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Deploying Python Web Applications with nginx and uWSGI Emperor</title><link>https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2016/02/10/deploying-python-web-apps-with-nginx-and-uwsgi-emperor/</link><dc:creator>Chris Warrick</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;You’ve just written a great Python web application. Now, you want to share it with the world. In order to do that, you need a server, and some software to do that for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is a comprehensive guide on how to accomplish that, on multiple Linux-based operating systems, using nginx and uWSGI Emperor. It doesn’t force you to use any specific web framework — Flask, Django, Pyramid, Bottle will all work. Written for Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS 7, Alma Linux, Rocky Linux and Arch Linux (should be helpful for other systems, too). Now with an Ansible Playbook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2016/02/10/deploying-python-web-apps-with-nginx-and-uwsgi-emperor/#toc-entry-1" role="doc-backlink"&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to deploy your web application, you need a server that gives you root and ssh access — in other words, a VPS (or a dedicated server, or a datacenter lease…). If you’re looking for a great VPS service for a low price, I recommend &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=Qy1lehF8PwzP"&gt;Hetzner Cloud&lt;/a&gt; (reflink &lt;a class="brackets" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2016/02/10/deploying-python-web-apps-with-nginx-and-uwsgi-emperor/#footnote-1" id="footnote-reference-1" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;1&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), which offers a pretty good entry-level VPS for €3.49 + VAT / month (with higher plans available for equally good prices). If you want to play along at home, without buying a VPS, you can create a virtual machine on your own, or use Vagrant with a Vagrant box for Fedora 35 (&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;fedora/35-cloud-base&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your server should also run a modern Linux-based operating system. This guide was written and tested on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, 20.04 LTS or newer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Debian 10 (buster), 11 (bullseye) or newer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fedora 33 or newer (with SELinux enabled and disabled)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;CentOS 7 (with SELinux enabled and disabled) — manual guide should also work on RHEL 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;AlmaLinux 8 (with SELinux enabled and disabled) — manual guide should also work on RHEL 8. Referred to as “EL8” collectively with Rocky Linux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rocky Linux 8 (with SELinux enabled and disabled) — manual guide should also work on RHEL 8. Referred to as “EL8” collectively with AlmaLinux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arch Linux&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debian 8 (jessie) 9 (stretch), Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, and Fedora 24 through 32 are not officially supported, even though they still probably work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if you’re using &lt;strong&gt;Docker&lt;/strong&gt;? The story is a bit complicated, and this guide does not apply, but do check the &lt;a class="reference internal" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2016/02/10/deploying-python-web-apps-with-nginx-and-uwsgi-emperor/#can-i-use-docker"&gt;Can I use Docker?&lt;/a&gt; at the end of this post for some hints on how to approach it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users of other Linux distributions (and perhaps other Unix flavors) can also follow this tutorial. This guide assumes &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;systemd&lt;/code&gt; as your init system; if you are not using systemd, you will have to get your own daemon files somewhere else. In places where the instructions are split three-way, try coming up with your own, reading documentation and config files; the Arch Linux instructions are probably the closest to upstream (but not always).  Unfortunately, all Linux distributions have their own ideas when it comes to running and managing nginx and uWSGI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nginx and uWSGI are considered best practices by most people. nginx is a fast, modern web server, with uWSGI support built in (without resorting to reverse proxying).  uWSGI is similarly aimed at speed.  The Emperor mode of uWSGI is recommended for init system integration by the uWSGI team, and it’s especially useful for multi-app deployments. (This guide is opinionated.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Install &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html"&gt;Ansible&lt;/a&gt; on your control computer (not necessarily the destination server).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clone the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Kwpolska/ansible-nginx-uwsgi"&gt;Playbook&lt;/a&gt; from GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;README.md&lt;/code&gt;. You should also understand how Ansible works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Configure (change three files: &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;hosts&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;group_vars/all&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;group_vars/os_&amp;lt;destination OS&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure all the dependencies are installed on your destination server&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;ansible-playbook&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-v&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;nginx-uwsgi.yml&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-i&lt;/span&gt; hosts&lt;/code&gt; and watch magic happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skip over to &lt;a class="reference internal" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2016/02/10/deploying-python-web-apps-with-nginx-and-uwsgi-emperor/#end-result"&gt;End result&lt;/a&gt; and test your site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I personally recommend the Playbook as a much less error-prone way to set up your app, it might not be compatible with everyone’s system, or otherwise be the wrong solution. The original manual configuration guide is still maintained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you are using the Playbook, you should still read this to find out what happens under the hood, and to find out about other caveats/required configuration changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the commands in this tutorial are meant to be run &lt;strong&gt;as root&lt;/strong&gt; — run &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;su&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;sudo su&lt;/code&gt; first to get an administrative shell. This tutorial assumes familiarity with basic Linux administration and command-line usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start by installing Python 3 (with venv), nginx and uWSGI. I recommend using your operating system’s packages. Make sure you are downloading the latest versions available for your OS (update the package cache first). For uWSGI, we need the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;logfile&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;python3&lt;/code&gt; plugins. (Arch Linux names the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;python3&lt;/code&gt; plugin &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;python&lt;/code&gt;; the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;logfile&lt;/code&gt; plugin may be built-in — check with your system repositories!). I’ll also install Git to clone the tutorial app, but it’s optional if your workflow does not involve Git.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ubuntu, Debian:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;section id="preparing-your-application"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2016/02/10/deploying-python-web-apps-with-nginx-and-uwsgi-emperor/#toc-entry-6" role="doc-backlink"&gt;Preparing your application&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial will work for any web framework. I will use &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Kwpolska/flask-demo-app"&gt;a really basic Flask app&lt;/a&gt; that has just one route (&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;), a static &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;hello.png&lt;/code&gt; file and a &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;favicon.ico&lt;/code&gt; for demonstration purposes. The app is pretty basic, but all the usual advanced features (templates, user logins, database access, etc.) would work without any other web server-related config. Note that the app does not use &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;app.run()&lt;/code&gt;. While you could add it, it would be used for local development and debugging only, and would have to be prepended by &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;if __name__ == '__main__':&lt;/code&gt; (if it wasn’t, that server would run instead of uWSGI, which is bad)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app will be installed somewhere under the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;/srv&lt;/code&gt; directory, which is a great place to store things like this. I’ll choose &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;/srv/myapp&lt;/code&gt; for this tutorial, but for real deployments, you should use something more distinguishable — the domain name is a great idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t use Flask, this tutorial also has instructions for other web frameworks (Django, Pyramid, Bottle) in the configuration files; it should be adjustable to any other WSGI-compliant framework/script nevertheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="sidebar"&gt;
&lt;p class="sidebar-title"&gt;Paths and locations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guide used to recommend creating the venv in &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;/srv/myapp&lt;/code&gt;. This was changed to improve in-place Python upgrades. Virtual environments should be ephemeral, so that &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;rm &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-rf&lt;/span&gt; $VIRTUAL_ENV&lt;/code&gt; is recoverable in less than 10 minutes and 2 commands. The old structure made the venv hard to delete without deleting &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;appdata&lt;/code&gt;. The current structure has &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;/srv/myapp/venv&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;/srv/myapp/appdata&lt;/code&gt; separate. An alternative structure would put the app in &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;/srv/myapp&lt;/code&gt;, but that requires including &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;venv&lt;/code&gt;, sockets and other deployment-specific files in &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt; (or having dirty working directories).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll start by creating a virtual environment, which is very easy with Python 3:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code sh"&gt;&lt;a id="rest_code_30cdbd6ac6174c62aeb351d3a164137c-1" name="rest_code_30cdbd6ac6174c62aeb351d3a164137c-1" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2016/02/10/deploying-python-web-apps-with-nginx-and-uwsgi-emperor/#rest_code_30cdbd6ac6174c62aeb351d3a164137c-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;mkdir&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/srv/myapp
&lt;a id="rest_code_30cdbd6ac6174c62aeb351d3a164137c-2" name="rest_code_30cdbd6ac6174c62aeb351d3a164137c-2" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2016/02/10/deploying-python-web-apps-with-nginx-and-uwsgi-emperor/#rest_code_30cdbd6ac6174c62aeb351d3a164137c-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;python3&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-m&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;venv&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--prompt&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;myapp&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/srv/myapp/venv
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(The &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;--prompt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; option is not supported on some old versions of Python, but you can just skip it if that’s the case, it’s just to make the prompt after &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;source bin/activate&lt;/code&gt; more informative.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we need to put our app there and install requirements. An example for the tutorial demo app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code sh"&gt;&lt;a id="rest_code_a9692761a5f443339a90cb2fbbecdf75-1" name="rest_code_a9692761a5f443339a90cb2fbbecdf75-1" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2016/02/10/deploying-python-web-apps-with-nginx-and-uwsgi-emperor/#rest_code_a9692761a5f443339a90cb2fbbecdf75-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/srv/myapp
&lt;a id="rest_code_a9692761a5f443339a90cb2fbbecdf75-2" name="rest_code_a9692761a5f443339a90cb2fbbecdf75-2" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2016/02/10/deploying-python-web-apps-with-nginx-and-uwsgi-emperor/#rest_code_a9692761a5f443339a90cb2fbbecdf75-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;git&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;clone&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;https://github.com/Kwpolska/flask-demo-app&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;appdata
&lt;a id="rest_code_a9692761a5f443339a90cb2fbbecdf75-3" name="rest_code_a9692761a5f443339a90cb2fbbecdf75-3" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2016/02/10/deploying-python-web-apps-with-nginx-and-uwsgi-emperor/#rest_code_a9692761a5f443339a90cb2fbbecdf75-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;venv/bin/pip&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;install&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-r&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;appdata/requirements.txt
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m storing my application data in the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;appdata&lt;/code&gt; subdirectory so that it doesn’t clutter the virtual environment (or vice versa).  You may also install the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;uwsgi&lt;/code&gt; package in the virtual environment, but it’s optional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this directory should be depends on your web framework.  For example, for a Django app, you should have an &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;appdata/manage.py&lt;/code&gt; file (in other words, &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;appdata&lt;/code&gt; is where your app structure starts).  I also assumed that the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;appdata&lt;/code&gt; folder should have a &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;static&lt;/code&gt; subdirectory with all static files, including &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;favicon.ico&lt;/code&gt; if you have one (we will add support for both in nginx).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, you should chown this directory to the user and group your server is going to run as.  This is especially important if uwsgi and nginx run as different users (as they do on Fedora). Run one of the following commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ubuntu, Debian:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code sh"&gt;&lt;a id="rest_code_3a795d7ea87e4de28a989b02b7ff0b17-1" name="rest_code_3a795d7ea87e4de28a989b02b7ff0b17-1" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2016/02/10/deploying-python-web-apps-with-nginx-and-uwsgi-emperor/#rest_code_3a795d7ea87e4de28a989b02b7ff0b17-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;chown&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-R&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;www-data:www-data&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/srv/myapp

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Save this file as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu, Debian: &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;/etc/uwsgi-emperor/vassals/myapp.ini&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fedora, CentOS, EL8 (AlmaLinux, Rocky Linux): &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;/etc/uwsgi.d/myapp.ini&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arch Linux: &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;/etc/uwsgi/vassals/myapp.ini&lt;/code&gt; (create the directory first and &lt;strong&gt;chown&lt;/strong&gt; it to http: &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;mkdir &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-p&lt;/span&gt; /etc/uwsgi/vassals; chown &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-R&lt;/span&gt; http:http /etc/uwsgi/vassals&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The options are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;socket&lt;/code&gt; — the socket file that will be used by your application. It’s usually a file path (Unix domain socket). You could use a local TCP socket, but it’s not recommended.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;chdir&lt;/code&gt; — the app directory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;binary-path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; — the uWSGI executable to use. Remove if you didn’t install the (optional) &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;uwsgi&lt;/code&gt; package in your virtual environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;virtualenv&lt;/code&gt; — the virtual environment for your application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;module&lt;/code&gt; — the name of the module that houses your application, and the object that speaks the WSGI interface, separated by colons. This depends on your web framework:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="table-responsive-lg"&gt;
&lt;table class="table table-bordered"&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style="width: 10%"&gt;Framework&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="width: 30%"&gt;Flask, Bottle&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="width: 30%"&gt;Django&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="width: 30%"&gt;Pyramid&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Package&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;module where &lt;code&gt;app&lt;/code&gt; is defined&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;em&gt;project&lt;/em&gt;.wsgi&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 0.9rem"&gt;(&lt;code style="font-size: 0.9rem"&gt;&lt;em&gt;project&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is the package with &lt;code style="font-size: 0.9rem"&gt;settings.py&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;module where &lt;code&gt;app&lt;/code&gt; is defined&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Callable&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Flask: &lt;code&gt;app&lt;/code&gt; instance&lt;br&gt;Bottle: &lt;code&gt;app = bottle.default_app()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;application&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;app = config.make_wsgi_app()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr class="table-active"&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Module&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code style="font-size: 1.2rem"&gt;&lt;em&gt;package&lt;/em&gt;:app&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code style="font-size: 1.2rem"&gt;&lt;em&gt;project&lt;/em&gt;.wsgi:application&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code style="font-size: 1.2rem"&gt;&lt;em&gt;package&lt;/em&gt;:app&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Caveats&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Make sure &lt;code&gt;app&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; in an &lt;code style="font-size: 0.85rem"&gt;if __name__ == '__main__':&lt;/code&gt; block&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Add environment variable for settings:&lt;br&gt;&lt;code style="font-size: 0.7rem"&gt;env = DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=&lt;em&gt;project&lt;/em&gt;.settings&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Make sure &lt;code&gt;app&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; in an &lt;code style="font-size: 0.85rem"&gt;if __name__ == '__main__':&lt;/code&gt; block (the demo quickstart does that!)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;uid&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;gid&lt;/code&gt; — the names of the user account to use for your server.  Use the same values as in the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;chown&lt;/code&gt; command above.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;processes&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;threads&lt;/code&gt; — control the resources devoted to this application. Because this is a simple hello app, I used one process with one thread, but for a real app, you will probably need more (you need to see what works the best; there is no algorithm to decide). Also, remember that if you use multiple processes, they don’t share memory (you need a database to share data between them).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;plugins&lt;/code&gt; — the list of uWSGI plugins to use. For Arch Linux, use &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;plugins = python&lt;/code&gt; (the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;logfile&lt;/code&gt; plugin is always active).  For CentOS 7 only (i.e. &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; for EL8), use &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;plugins = python36&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;logger&lt;/code&gt; — the path to your app-specific logfile. (Other logging facilities are available, but this one is the easiest, especially for multiple applications on the same server)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;env&lt;/code&gt; — environment variables to pass to your app. Useful for configuration, may be specified multiple times. Example for Django: &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;env = DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=project.settings&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can test your configuration by running &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;uwsgi &lt;span class="pre"&gt;--ini&lt;/span&gt; /path/to/myapp.ini&lt;/code&gt; (disable the logger for stderr output or run &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;tail &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-f&lt;/span&gt; /srv/myapp/uwsgi.log&lt;/code&gt; in another window).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re using &lt;strong&gt;Fedora&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;CentOS&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;EL8&lt;/strong&gt;, there are two configuration changes you need to make globally: in &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;/etc/uwsgi.ini&lt;/code&gt;, disable the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;emperor-tyrant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; option (which we don’t need, as it sets uid/gid for every process based on the owner of the related &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;.ini&lt;/code&gt; config file — we use one global setup) and set &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;gid = nginx&lt;/code&gt;.  We’ll need this so that nginx can talk to your socket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="nginx-configuration"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to configure our web server. Here’s a basic configuration that will get us started:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save this file as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that this file is a very basic and rudimentary configuration. This configuration is fine for local testing, but for a real deployment, you will need to adjust it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;set &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;listen&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;443 ssl&lt;/code&gt; and create a http→https redirect on port 80 (you can get a free SSL certificate from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://letsencrypt.org/"&gt;Let’s Encrypt&lt;/a&gt;; make sure to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://raymii.org/s/tutorials/Strong_SSL_Security_On_nginx.html"&gt;configure SSL properly&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;set &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;server_name&lt;/code&gt; to your real domain name&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;you might also want to add custom error pages, log files, or change anything else that relates to your web server — consult other nginx guides for details&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;nginx usually has some server already enabled by default — edit &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;/etc/nginx/nginx.conf&lt;/code&gt; or remove their configuration files from your sites directory to disable it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="service-setup"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you’ve configured uWSGI and nginx, you need to enable and start the system services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verify the service is running with &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;systemctl status emperor.uwsgi&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure you followed the extra note about editing &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;/etc/uwsgi.ini&lt;/code&gt; earlier and run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code sh"&gt;&lt;a id="rest_code_9064804fee7244cd9f9cc588e7d8bf24-1" name="rest_code_9064804fee7244cd9f9cc588e7d8bf24-1" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2016/02/10/deploying-python-web-apps-with-nginx-and-uwsgi-emperor/#rest_code_9064804fee7244cd9f9cc588e7d8bf24-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;systemctl&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;enable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;nginx&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;uwsgi
&lt;a id="rest_code_9064804fee7244cd9f9cc588e7d8bf24-2" name="rest_code_9064804fee7244cd9f9cc588e7d8bf24-2" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2016/02/10/deploying-python-web-apps-with-nginx-and-uwsgi-emperor/#rest_code_9064804fee7244cd9f9cc588e7d8bf24-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;systemctl&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;start&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;nginx&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;uwsgi
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verify the service is running with &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;systemctl status uwsgi&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you disabled SELinux, this is enough to get an app working and you can skip over to the next section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to use SELinux, you need to do the following to allow nginx to read static files:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code sh"&gt;&lt;a id="rest_code_2b0d1bf27c0f4a72a02c302e008c8f1c-1" name="rest_code_2b0d1bf27c0f4a72a02c302e008c8f1c-1" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2016/02/10/deploying-python-web-apps-with-nginx-and-uwsgi-emperor/#rest_code_2b0d1bf27c0f4a72a02c302e008c8f1c-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;setenforce&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a id="rest_code_2b0d1bf27c0f4a72a02c302e008c8f1c-2" name="rest_code_2b0d1bf27c0f4a72a02c302e008c8f1c-2" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2016/02/10/deploying-python-web-apps-with-nginx-and-uwsgi-emperor/#rest_code_2b0d1bf27c0f4a72a02c302e008c8f1c-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;chcon&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-R&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;system_u:system_r:httpd_t:s0&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/srv/myapp/appdata/static
&lt;a id="rest_code_2b0d1bf27c0f4a72a02c302e008c8f1c-3" name="rest_code_2b0d1bf27c0f4a72a02c302e008c8f1c-3" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2016/02/10/deploying-python-web-apps-with-nginx-and-uwsgi-emperor/#rest_code_2b0d1bf27c0f4a72a02c302e008c8f1c-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;setenforce&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We now need to install a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pub/nginx-uwsgi.pp"&gt;SELinux policy&lt;/a&gt; (that I created for this project; updated 2020-05-02) to allow nginx and uWSGI to communicate.
Download &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pub/nginx-uwsgi.pp"&gt;nginx-uwsgi.pp&lt;/a&gt; and run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code sh"&gt;&lt;a id="rest_code_e287d170685d4162b4f6a6d969245e79-1" name="rest_code_e287d170685d4162b4f6a6d969245e79-1" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2016/02/10/deploying-python-web-apps-with-nginx-and-uwsgi-emperor/#rest_code_e287d170685d4162b4f6a6d969245e79-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;semodule&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-i&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;nginx-uwsgi.pp
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, this is enough (you can delete the file). In case it isn’t, please read SELinux documentation, check audit logs, and look into &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;audit2allow&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="for-ubuntu-and-debian"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2016/02/10/deploying-python-web-apps-with-nginx-and-uwsgi-emperor/#toc-entry-13" role="doc-backlink"&gt;For Ubuntu and Debian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu and Debian (still!) use LSB services for uWSGI. Because LSB services are awful, we’re going to set up our own systemd-based (native) service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start by disabling the LSB service that comes with Ubuntu and Debian:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code sh"&gt;&lt;a id="rest_code_5f8202b34ca942f2986ded1df369440f-1" name="rest_code_5f8202b34ca942f2986ded1df369440f-1" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2016/02/10/deploying-python-web-apps-with-nginx-and-uwsgi-emperor/#rest_code_5f8202b34ca942f2986ded1df369440f-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;systemctl&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;stop&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;uwsgi-emperor
&lt;a id="rest_code_5f8202b34ca942f2986ded1df369440f-2" name="rest_code_5f8202b34ca942f2986ded1df369440f-2" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2016/02/10/deploying-python-web-apps-with-nginx-and-uwsgi-emperor/#rest_code_5f8202b34ca942f2986ded1df369440f-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;systemctl&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;disable&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;uwsgi-emperor
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copy the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;.service&lt;/code&gt; file from the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/Systemd.html#adding-the-emperor-to-systemd"&gt;uWSGI systemd documentation&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;/etc/systemd/system/emperor.uwsgi.service&lt;/code&gt;.  Change the ExecStart line to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code ini"&gt;&lt;a id="rest_code_fd8dc581ea4c4915bea1507b8883dea3-1" name="rest_code_fd8dc581ea4c4915bea1507b8883dea3-1" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2016/02/10/deploying-python-web-apps-with-nginx-and-uwsgi-emperor/#rest_code_fd8dc581ea4c4915bea1507b8883dea3-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;ExecStart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;/usr/bin/uwsgi --ini /etc/uwsgi-emperor/emperor.ini&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can now reload systemd daemons and enable the services:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code sh"&gt;&lt;a id="rest_code_f8e123e3b7ca40bfa513e7d6f48143a6-1" name="rest_code_f8e123e3b7ca40bfa513e7d6f48143a6-1" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2016/02/10/deploying-python-web-apps-with-nginx-and-uwsgi-emperor/#rest_code_f8e123e3b7ca40bfa513e7d6f48143a6-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;systemctl&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;daemon-reload

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verify the service is running with &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;systemctl status emperor.uwsgi&lt;/code&gt;.  (Ignore
the warning about no request plugin)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your web service should now be running at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://localhost/"&gt;http://localhost/&lt;/a&gt; (or wherever you set up server to listen).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you used the demo application, you should see something like this (complete with the favicon and image greeting):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="/images/nginx-uwsgi-demo.png" class="centered" src="https://chriswarrick.com/images/nginx-uwsgi-demo.png"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, everything works. If it doesn’t:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check your nginx, system (&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;journalctl&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;systemctl status SERVICE&lt;/code&gt;) and uwsgi (&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;/srv/myapp/uwsgi.log&lt;/code&gt;) logs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure you followed all instructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you get a default site, disable that site in nginx config (&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;/etc/nginx/nginx.conf&lt;/code&gt; or your sites directory).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a firewall installed, make sure to open the ports your web server runs on (typically 80/443). For &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;firewalld&lt;/code&gt; (Fedora, CentOS, EL8):&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code sh"&gt;&lt;a id="rest_code_0519f72245bb4c008a05d6083734a7a9-1" name="rest_code_0519f72245bb4c008a05d6083734a7a9-1" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2016/02/10/deploying-python-web-apps-with-nginx-and-uwsgi-emperor/#rest_code_0519f72245bb4c008a05d6083734a7a9-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;firewall-cmd&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--add-service&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;http
&lt;a id="rest_code_0519f72245bb4c008a05d6083734a7a9-2" name="rest_code_0519f72245bb4c008a05d6083734a7a9-2" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2016/02/10/deploying-python-web-apps-with-nginx-and-uwsgi-emperor/#rest_code_0519f72245bb4c008a05d6083734a7a9-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;firewall-cmd&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--add-service&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;https
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it still does not work, feel free to ask in the comments, mentioning your distribution, installation method, and what doesn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="can-i-use-docker"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2016/02/10/deploying-python-web-apps-with-nginx-and-uwsgi-emperor/#toc-entry-16" role="doc-backlink"&gt;Can I use Docker?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog post is written for systems running standalone. But Docker is a bit special, in that it offers a limited subset of OS features this workflow expects. The main issue is with user accounts, which generally work weird in Docker, and I had issues with &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;setuid&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;setgid&lt;/code&gt; as used by uWSGI. Another issue is the lack of systemd, which means that another part of the tutorial fails to apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial uses uWSGI Emperor, which can run multiple sites at once, and offers other management features (such as seamless code restarts with &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;touch /etc/uwsgi/vassals/myapp.ini&lt;/code&gt;) that may not be useful or easy to use in a Docker environment. You’d probably also run uWSGI and nginx in separate containers in a typical Docker deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless, many parts of this tutorial can be used with Docker, although with the aforementioned adjustments. I have done some work on this topic. This tutorial has an Ansible Playbook attached, and the tutorial/playbook are compatible with five Linux distros in multiple versions. How do I know that there were no unexpected bugs in an older version? I could grab a Vagrant image or set up a VM. I do that when I need specific testing, but doing it for each of the distros on each update would take at least half an hour, probably even more. Yeah, that needs automating. I decided to use GitHub Actions for the CI, which can run anything, as long as you provide a Dockerfile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Docker images were designed to support running the Playbook and testing it. But the changes, setups and patches could be a good starting point if you wanted to make your own Docker containers that could run in production. You can take a look at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Kwpolska/ansible-nginx-uwsgi/tree/master/ci"&gt;the Docker files for CI&lt;/a&gt; The images support all 5 distros using their base images, but you could probably use Alpine images, or the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;python&lt;/code&gt; docker images; be careful not to mix Python versions in the latter case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, I still prefer to run without Docker, directly on the system.  Less resources wasted and less indirection.  Which is why this guide does it the traditional way.&lt;/p&gt;

The app in question was
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://users.getnikola.com/"&gt;Nikola Users&lt;/a&gt;, which is a very simple CRUD
app.  And yet, the Flask code was a mess, full of bugs and vulnerabilities.
Eight hours later, I had a fully functional Django app that did more and fixed
all problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;section id="original-flask-app"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Original Flask app&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original Flask app had a ton of problems.  In order to make it anywhere
near useful, I would need to spend hours.  Here’s just a few of
them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;357 lines of spaghetti code (295 SLOC), all in one file&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;No form data validation, no CSRF &lt;a class="brackets" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2015/10/11/rewriting-a-flask-app-in-django/#footnote-1" id="footnote-reference-1" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;1&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; protection (it did have XSS protection
though)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Login using Mozilla Persona, which requries JavaScript, is a bit kludgey, and
feels desolate (and also had me store the admin e-mail list in code)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geopolitics issues: using country flags for languages&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of things were implemented by hand&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;SQLAlchemy is very verbose&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;no DB migrations (makes enhancements harder)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Languages implemented as a PostgreSQL integer array&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding a language required running a command-line script and &lt;strong&gt;restarting the
app&lt;/strong&gt; (languages were cached in Python dicts with no way to reload them from
the database; that would require talking through uWSGI anyway because there
were multiple processes involved)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The templates were slightly hacky (the page title was set in each individual
template and not in the view code); menus hacked together in HTML with no
highlighting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Python 2.7&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="the-rewrite"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The rewrite&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started the process by opening &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/"&gt;Django documentation&lt;/a&gt;, with its wonderful
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/intro/tutorial01/"&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt;.  Now, I have written a couple basic Django apps before, but
the majority of them didn’t do much.  In other words, I didn’t have a lot of experience.  Especially with taking user input and relationships.  It took me about 8 hours to get feature parity, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting all the features was really simple.  For example, to get a many-to-many
relationship for languages, I had to write just one line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code python"&gt;&lt;a id="rest_code_561e375136824becadaa1e40063fb209-1" name="rest_code_561e375136824becadaa1e40063fb209-1" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2015/10/11/rewriting-a-flask-app-in-django/#rest_code_561e375136824becadaa1e40063fb209-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;languages&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;models&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ManyToManyField&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Language&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it.  I didn’t have to run through complicated SQLAlchemy documentation,
which provides a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_1_0/orm/basic_relationships.html#many-to-many"&gt;13-line solution&lt;/a&gt; to the same problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Django also simplified New Relic integration, as the browser JS can be implemented
using Django template tags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Django is not without its problems, though.  I got a very cryptic traceback
when I did this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code python"&gt;&lt;a id="rest_code_62ec31f77ca34aecb71b98660a4cf674-1" name="rest_code_62ec31f77ca34aecb71b98660a4cf674-1" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2015/10/11/rewriting-a-flask-app-in-django/#rest_code_62ec31f77ca34aecb71b98660a4cf674-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;publish_email&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;forms&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;BooleanField&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Publish e-mail"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;required&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kc"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a id="rest_code_62ec31f77ca34aecb71b98660a4cf674-2" name="rest_code_62ec31f77ca34aecb71b98660a4cf674-2" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2015/10/11/rewriting-a-flask-app-in-django/#rest_code_62ec31f77ca34aecb71b98660a4cf674-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="ne"&gt;TypeError&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"BooleanField() got multiple values for argument 'required'"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real problem with this code?  I forgot the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;label=&lt;/code&gt; keyword.  The
problem is, the model API accepts this syntax — &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;verbose_name&lt;/code&gt; is the first
argument.  (I am not actually using the labels though, I write my own form
HTML)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the Django version is much cleaner.  And the best part of all?  There
are no magic global objects (&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;g&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;session&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;request&lt;/code&gt;) and
decorator-based views (which are a bit of syntax abuse IMO).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;382 lines of code (297 SLOC) over 6 files — much cleaner, and with less long lines&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;form data validation (via Django), CSRF and XSS protection&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Login using Django built-in authentication, without JavaScript&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Language codes (granted, I could’ve done that really easily back in Flask)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tried-and-true implementations of common patterns&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Django models are much more readable and friendly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Django-provided DB migrations (generated automatically!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Languages implemented using Django many-to-many relationships&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding a language is possible from the Django built-in admin panel and is
reflected immediately (no caching)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Titles and menus in code&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Python 3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;New features: featured sites; show only a specified language — were really easy to add&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;aside class="footnote-list brackets"&gt;
&lt;aside class="footnote brackets" id="footnote-1" role="doc-footnote"&gt;
&lt;span class="label"&gt;&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a role="doc-backlink" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2015/10/11/rewriting-a-flask-app-in-django/#footnote-reference-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had some &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;CSRF_ENABLED&lt;/code&gt; variable, but it did not seem to be actually
used by anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
