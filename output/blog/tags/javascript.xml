There is an area of Python that many developers have problems with. This is an area that has seen many different solutions pop up over the years, with many different opinions, wars, and attempts to solve it. Many have complained about the packaging ecosystem and tools making their lives harder. Many beginners are confused about virtual environments. But does it have to be this way? Are the current solutions to packaging problems any good? And is the organization behind most of the packaging tools and standards part of the problem itself?
Join me on a journey through packaging in Python and elsewhere. We’ll start by describing the classic packaging stack (involving setuptools and friends), the scientific stack (with conda), and some of the modern/alternate tools, such as Pipenv, Poetry, Hatch, or PDM. We’ll also look at some examples of packaging and dependency-related workflows seen elsewhere (Node.js and .NET). We’ll also take a glimpse at a possible future (with a venv-less workflow with PDM), and see if the PyPA agrees with the vision and insights of eight thousand users.

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#toc-entry-1" role="doc-backlink">The plethora of tools</a></h1>
<p>There are many packaging-related tools in Python. All of them with different authors, lineages, and often different opinions, although most of them are now unified under the Python Packaging Authority (PyPA) umbrella. Let’s take a look at them.</p>
<section id="the-classic-stack">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#toc-entry-2" role="doc-backlink">The classic stack</a></h2>
<p>The classic Python packaging stack consists of many semi-related tools. Setuptools, probably the oldest tool of the group, and itself based on <code class="docutils literal">distutils</code>, which is part of the standard library (although it will be removed in Python 3.12), is responsible for installing a single package. It previously used <code class="docutils literal">setup.py</code> files to do its job, which required arbitrary code execution. It then added support for non-executable metadata specification formats: <code class="docutils literal">setup.cfg</code>, and also <code class="docutils literal">pyproject.toml</code> (partially still in beta). However, you aren’t supposed to use <code class="docutils literal">setup.py</code> files directly these days, you’re supposed to be using pip. Pip installs packages, usually from the PyPI, but it can also support other sources (such as git repositories or the local filesystem). But where does pip install things? The default used to be to install globally and system-wide, which meant you could introduce conflicts between packages installed by pip and apt (or whatever the system package manager is). Even with a user-wide install (which pip is likely to attempt these days), you can still end up with conflicts, and you can also have conflicts in which package A requests X version 1.0.0, but package B expects X version 2.0.0—but A and B are not at all related and could live separately with their preferred version of X. Enter <code class="docutils literal">venv</code>, a standard library descendant of <code class="docutils literal">virtualenv</code>, which can create a lightweight virtual environment for packages to live in. This virtual environment gives you the separation from system packages and from different environments, but it is still tied to the system Python in some ways (and if the system Python disappears, the virtual environment stops working).</p>
<p>A few extra tools would be used in a typical packaging workflow. The <code class="docutils literal">wheel</code> package enhances Setuptools with the ability to generate wheels, which are ready-to-install (without running <code class="docutils literal">setup.py</code>). Wheels can either be pure-Python and be installed anywhere, or they can contain pre-compiled extension modules (things written in C) for a given OS and Python (and there’s even a standard that allows building and distributing one wheel for all typical Linux distros). The <code class="docutils literal">wheel</code> package should be an implementation detail, something existing inside Setuptools and/or pip, but users need to be aware of it if they want to make wheels on their system, because virtual environments produced by <code class="docutils literal">venv</code> do not have <code class="docutils literal">wheel</code> installed. Regular users who do not maintain their own packages may sometimes be told that pip is using something legacy because <code class="docutils literal">wheel</code> is not installed, which is not a good user experience. Package authors also need <code class="docutils literal">twine</code>, whose sole task is uploading source distributions or wheels, created with other tools, to PyPI (and there’s not much more to say about that tool).</p>

<section id="and-a-few-extensions">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#toc-entry-3" role="doc-backlink">…and a few extensions</a></h2>
<p>Over the years, there have been a few tools that are based on things from the classic stack. For example, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pip-tools</span></code> can simplify dependency management. While <code class="docutils literal">pip freeze</code> lets you produce a file with everything installed in your environment, there is no way to specify the dependencies you need, and get a lock file with specific versions and transitive dependencies (without installing and freezing everything), there is no easy way to skip development dependencies (e.g. IPython) when you <code class="docutils literal">pip freeze</code>, and there is no workflow to update all your dependencies with just pip. <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pip-tools</span></code> adds two tools, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pip-compile</span></code> which takes in <code class="docutils literal">requirements.in</code> files with the packages you care about, and produces a <code class="docutils literal">requrirements.txt</code> with pinned versions of them and all transitive dependencies; and also <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pip-sync</span></code>, which can install <code class="docutils literal">requirements.txt</code> and removes things not listed in it.</p>
<p>Another tool that might come in useful is <code class="docutils literal">virtualenvwrapper</code>, which can help you manage (create and activate) virtual environments in a central location. It has a few bells and whistles (such as custom hooks to do actions on every virtualenv creation), although for basic usage, you could replace it with a single-line shell function.</p>
<p>Yet another tool that works alongside the classic toolset is <code class="docutils literal">pipx</code>, which creates and manages virtual environments for apps written in Python. You tell it to <code class="docutils literal">pipx install Nikola</code>, and it will create a virtual environment somewhere, install Nikola into it, and put a script for launching it in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">~/.local/bin</span></code>. While you could do it all yourself with venv and some symlinks, pipx can take care of this, and you don’t need to remember where the virtual environment is.</p>

<section id="the-scientific-stack-and-conda">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#toc-entry-4" role="doc-backlink">The scientific stack and conda</a></h2>
<p>The scientific Python community have had their own tools for many years. The conda tool can manage environments and packages. It doesn’t use PyPI and wheels, but rather packages from conda channels (which are prebuilt, and expect an Anaconda-distributed Python). Back in the day, when there were no wheels, this was the easiest way to get things installed on Windows; this is not as much of a problem now with binary wheels on PyPI—but the Anaconda stack is still popular in the scientific world. Conda packages can be built with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">conda-build</span></code>, which is separate, but closely related to <code class="docutils literal">conda</code> itself. Conda packages are not compatible with <code class="docutils literal">pip</code> in any way, they do not follow the packaging standards used by other tools. Is this good? No, because it makes integrating the two worlds harder, but also yes, because many problems that apply to scientific packages (and their C/C++ extension modules, and their high-performance numeric libraries, and other things) do not apply to other uses of Python, so having a separate tool lets people focusing the other uses simplify their workflows.</p>

<section id="the-new-tools">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#toc-entry-5" role="doc-backlink">The new tools</a></h2>
<p>A few years ago, new packaging tools appeared. Now, there were lots of “new fancy tools” introduced in the past, with setuptools extending distutils, then distribute forking setuptools, then distribute being merged back…</p>
<p>The earliest “new tool” was Pipenv. Pipenv had really terrible and misleading marketing, and it merged pip and venv, in that Pipenv would create a venv and install packages in it (from <code class="docutils literal">Pipfile</code> or <code class="docutils literal">Pipfile.lock</code>). Pipenv can place the venv in the project folder, or hide it somewhere in the project folder (the latter is the default). However, Pipenv does not handle any packages related to packaging your code, so it’s useful only for developing non-installable applications (Django sites, for example). If you’re a library developer, you need setuptools anyway.</p>
<p>The second new tool was Poetry. It manages environments and dependencies in a similar way to Pipenv, but it can also build <code class="docutils literal">.whl</code> files with your code, and it can upload wheels and source distributions to PyPI. This means it has pretty much all the features the other tools have, except you need just one tool. However, Poetry is opinionated, and its opinions are sometimes incompatible with the rest of the packaging scene. Poetry uses the <code class="docutils literal">pyproject.toml</code> standard, but it does not follow the standard specifying how metadata should be represented in a <code class="docutils literal">pyproject.toml</code> file (PEP 621), instead using a custom <code class="docutils literal">[tool.poetry]</code> table. This is partly because Poetry came out before PEP 621, but the PEP was accepted over 2 years ago—the biggest compatibility problem is Poetry’s node-inspired <code class="docutils literal">~</code> and <code class="docutils literal">^</code> dependency version markers, which are not compatible with PEP 508 (the dependency specification standard). Poetry can package C extension modules, although it uses setuptools’ infrastructure for this (and requires a custom <code class="docutils literal">build.py</code> script).</p>
<p>Another similar tool is Hatch. This tool can also manage environments (it allows multiple environments per project, but it does not allow to put them in the project directory), and it can manage packages (but without lockfile support). Hatch can also be used to package a project (with PEP 621-compliant <code class="docutils literal">pyproject.toml</code> files) and upload it to PyPI. It does not support C extension modules.</p>
<p>A tool that tries to be a simpler re-imagining of Setuptools is Flit. It can build and install a package using a <code class="docutils literal">pyproject.toml</code> file. It also supports uploads to PyPI. It lacks support for C extension modules, and it expects you to manage environments on your own.</p>
<p>There’s one more interesting (albeit not popular or well-known) tool. This tool is PDM. It can manage venvs (but it defaults to the saner <code class="docutils literal">.venv</code> location), manage dependencies, and it uses a standards-compliant <code class="docutils literal">pyproject.toml</code>. There’s also a curious little feature called PEP 582 support, which we’ll talk about later.</p>

<p>The previous sections mentioned 14 (fourteen!) distinct tools. As we’ll discover soon, that’s at least 12 too many. Let’s try to compare them.</p>

</details><p>You should pay close attention to the Maintainer column in the table. The vast majority of them are maintained by PyPA, the Python Packaging Authority. Even more curiously, the two tools that have the most “Yes” values (Poetry and PDM) are not maintained by the PyPA, but instead other people completely independent of them and not participating in the working group. So, is the working group successful, if it cannot produce one fully-featured tool? Is the group successful if it has multiple projects with overlapping responsibilities? Should the group focus their efforts on standards like <a class="reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/">PEP 517</a>, which is a common API for packaging tools, and which also encourages the creation of even more incompatible and competing tools?</p>
<p>Most importantly: which tool should a beginner use? The PyPA has a few guides and tutorials, one is <a class="reference external" href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/">using pip + venv</a>, another is <a class="reference external" href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/managing-dependencies/">using pipenv</a> (why would you still do that?), and <a class="reference external" href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/">another tutorial</a> that lets you pick between Hatchling (hatch’s build backend), setuptools, Flit, and PDM, without explaining the differences between them—and without using any environment tools, and without using Hatch’s/PDM’s build and PyPI upload features (instead opting to use <code class="docutils literal">python <span class="pre">-m</span> build</code> and <code class="docutils literal">twine</code>). The concept of virtual environments can be very confusing for beginners, and managing virtual environments is difficult if everyone has incompatible opinions about it.</p>
<p>It is also notable that <a class="reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/">PEP 20</a>, the Zen of Python, states this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Python packaging definitely does not follow it <a class="brackets" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#footnote-1" id="footnote-reference-1" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>1<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>. There are 14 ways, and none of them is obvious or the only good one. All in all, this is an unsalvageable mess. Why can’t Python pick one tool? What does the competition do? We’ll look at this in a minute. But first, let’s talk about the elephant in the room: Python virtual environments.</p>
</section>
<section id="does-python-really-need-virtual-environments">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#toc-entry-7" role="doc-backlink">Does Python really need virtual environments?</a></h1>
<p>Python relies on virtual environments for separation between projects. Virtual environments (aka virtualenvs or venvs) are folders with symlinks to a system-installed Python, and their own set of site-packages. There are a few problems with them:</p>
<section id="how-to-use-python-from-a-virtual-environment">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#toc-entry-8" role="doc-backlink">How to use Python from a virtual environment?</a></h2>
<p>There are two ways to do this. The first one is to activate it, by running the activate shell script installed in the environment’s bin directory. Another is to run the python executable (or any other script in the bin directory) directly from the venv. <a class="brackets" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#footnote-2" id="footnote-reference-2" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>2<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p>
<p>Activating venvs directly is more convenient for developers, but it also has some problems. Sometimes, activation fails to work, due to the shell caching the location of things in <code class="docutils literal">$PATH</code>. Also, beginners are taught to <code class="docutils literal">activate</code> and run <code class="docutils literal">python</code>, which means they might be confused and try to use activate in scripts or cronjobs (but in those environments, you should not activate venvs, and instead use the Python executable directly). Virtual environment activation is more state you need to be aware of, and if you forget about it, or if it breaks, you might end up messing up your user-wide (or worse, system-wide) Python packages.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-are-system-pythons-and-virtual-environments-related">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#toc-entry-9" role="doc-backlink">How are (system) Pythons and virtual environments related?</a></h2>
<p>The virtual environment depends very tightly on the (system/global/pyenv-installed) Python used to create it. This is good for disk-space reasons (clean virtual environments don’t take up very much space), but this also makes the environment more fragile. If the Python used to create the environment is removed, the virtual environment stops working. If you fully manage your own Python, then it’s probably not going to happen, but if you depend on a system Python, upgrading packages on your OS might end up replacing Python 3.10 with Python 3.11. Some distributions (e.g. Ubuntu) would only make a jump like this on a new distribution release (so you can plan ahead), some of them (e.g. Arch) are rolling-release and a regular system upgrade may include a new Python, whereas some (e.g. Homebrew) make it even worse by using paths that include the patch Python version (3.x.y), which cause virtual environments to break much more often.</p>
</section>
<section id="how-to-manage-virtual-environments">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#toc-entry-10" role="doc-backlink">How to manage virtual environments?</a></h2>
<p>The original virtualenv tool, and its simplified standard library rewrite venv, allow you to put a virtual environment anywhere in the file system, as long as you have write privileges there. This has led to people and tools inventing their own standards. Virtualenvwrapper stores environments in a central location, and does not care about their contents. Pipenv and poetry allow you to choose (either a central location or the .venv directory in the project), and environments are tied to a project (they will use the project-specific environment if you’re in the project directory). Hatch stores environments in a central location, and it allows you to have multiple environments per project (but there is no option to share environments between projects).</p>
<p>Brett Cannon has recently done <a class="reference external" href="https://snarky.ca/classifying-python-virtual-environment-workflows/">a survey</a>, and it has shown the community is split on their workflows: some people use a central location, some put them in the project directory, some people have multiple environments with different Python versions, some people reuse virtualenvs between projects… Everyone has different needs, and different opinions. For example, I use a central directory (~/virtualenvs) and reuse environments when working on Nikola (sharing the same environment between development and 4 Nikola sites). But on the other hand, when deploying web apps, the venv lives in the project folder, because this venv needs to be used by processes running as different users (me, root, or the service account for the web server, which might have interactive login disabled, or whose home directory may be set to something ephemeral).</p>
<p>So: <strong>does Python need virtual environments?</strong> Perhaps looking how other languages handle this problem can help us figure this out for Python?</p>

<p>Our <code class="docutils literal">package.json</code> file now lists the dependency, and we’ve also got a lock file (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">package-lock.json</span></code>), which records all the dependency versions used for this install. If this file is kept in the repository, any future attempts to <code class="docutils literal">npm install</code> will use the dependency versions listed in this file, ensuring everything will work the same as it did originally (unless one of those packages were to get removed from the registry).</p>

<p>Badly designed packages aside, we can see an important difference from Python in that there is <strong>no virtual environment</strong>, and all the packages live in the project directory.

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If you’re using a manually managed venv, and it lives in a central directory, all is well.</p></li>
<li><p>If you or your tool places the venv in the project directory, the venv is now broken, and you need to recreate it (hope you have a recent <code class="docutils literal">requirements.txt</code>!)</p></li>

<p>Some packages may expose executable scripts (with the <code class="docutils literal">bin</code> property). Those can be run in three ways:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Installed globally using <code class="docutils literal">npm install <span class="pre">-g</span></code>, which would put the script in a global location that’s likely in <code class="docutils literal">$PATH</code> (e.g. <code class="docutils literal">/usr/local/bin</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Installed locally using <code class="docutils literal">npm install</code>, and executed with the <code class="docutils literal">npx</code> tool or manually by running the script in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">node_packages/.bin</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Not installed at all, but executed using the <code class="docutils literal">npx</code> tool, which will install it into a cache and run it.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Also, if we wanted to publish our thing, we can just run <code class="docutils literal">npm publish</code> (after logging in with <code class="docutils literal">npm login</code>).</p>

<p>We get three things: a <code class="docutils literal">mydotnetproject.csproj</code> file, which defines a few properties of our project; <code class="docutils literal">Program.cs</code>, which is a hello world program, and <code class="docutils literal">obj/</code>, which contains a few files you don’t need to care about.</p>
<p>Let’s try adding a dependency. For a pointless example, but slightly more reasonable than the JS one, we’ll use <code class="docutils literal">AutoFixture</code>, which brings in a dependency on <code class="docutils literal">Fare</code>. If we run <code class="docutils literal">dotnet add package AutoFixture</code>, we get some console output, and our <code class="docutils literal">mydotnetproject.csproj</code> now looks like this:</p>

<p>(We could just use C#’s/.NET’s built-in random number generator, AutoFixture is complete overkill here—it’s meant for auto-generating test data, with support for arbitrary classes and other data structures, and we’re just getting two random ints here. I’m using AutoFixture for this example, because it’s simple to use and demonstrate, and because it gets us a transitive dependency.)</p>
<p>And now, we can run it:</p>

<p>We have a single output file that contains our program, its dependencies, and parts of the .NET runtime. We also get debugging symbols if we want to run our binary with a .NET debugger and see the associated source code. (There are ways to make the binary file smaller, and we can move most arguments of <code class="docutils literal">dotnet publish</code> to the .csproj file, but this post is about Python, not .NET, so I’m not going to focus on them too much.)</p>

<li><p>You can run built .NET projects as any user, from anywhere in the filesystem.</p></li>
<li><p>All you need to run your code is the output directory (publishing is optional, but useful to have a cleaner output, to simplify deployment, and to possibly enable compilation to native code).</p></li>

<p>Locking dependencies is disabled by default, but if you add <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;RestorePackagesWithLockFile&gt;true&lt;/RestorePackagesWithLockFile&gt;</span></code> to the <code class="docutils literal">&lt;PropertyGroup&gt;</code> in your <code class="docutils literal">.csproj</code> file, you can enable it (and get a <code class="docutils literal">packages.lock.json</code> file in output).</p>
<p>Regarding <a class="reference external" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/global-tools">command line tools</a>, .NET has support for those as well. They can be installed globally or locally, and may be accessed via $PATH or via the <code class="docutils literal">dotnet</code> command.</p>
<p>As for publishing your package to NuGet.org or to another repository, you might want to look at the <a class="reference external" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/quickstart/create-and-publish-a-package-using-the-dotnet-cli">full docs</a> for more details, but the short version is:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Add some metadata to the <code class="docutils literal">.csproj</code> file (e.g. <code class="docutils literal">PackageId</code> and <code class="docutils literal">Version</code>)</p></li>
<li><p>Run <code class="docutils literal">dotnet pack</code> to get a <code class="docutils literal">.nupkg</code> file</p></li>
<li><p>Run <code class="docutils literal">dotnet nuget push</code> to upload the <code class="docutils literal">.nupkg</code> file (passing the file name and an API key)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Once again, everything is done with a single <code class="docutils literal">dotnet</code> tool. The .NET IDEs (in particular, Visual Studio and Rider) do offer friendly GUI versions of many features. Some of those GUIs might be doings things slightly differently behind the scenes, but this is transparent to the user (and the backend is still MSBuild or a close derivative of it). I can take a CLI-created project, add a dependency from Rider, and publish an executable from VS, and everything will work the same. And perhaps XML files aren’t as cool as TOML, but they’re still easy to work with in this case.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#toc-entry-18" role="doc-backlink">Other languages and ecosystems</a></h2>
<p>While we have explored two tools for two languages in depth, there are also other languages that deserve at least a mention. In the <strong>Java</strong> world, the two most commonly used tools are Maven and Gradle. Both tools can be used to manage dependencies and build artifacts that can be executed or distributed further (things like JAR files). Other tools with support for building Java projects exist, but most people just pick one of the two. The community of <strong>Scala</strong>, which is another JVM-based language, prefers sbt (which can be used for plain Java as well), but there are also Maven or Gradle users in that community. Finally, two new-ish languages which are quite popular in the recent times, <strong>Go</strong> and <strong>Rust</strong>, have first-party tooling integrated with the rest of the toolchain. The <code class="docutils literal">go</code> command-line tool can accomplish many build/dependency/packaging tasks. Rust’s <code class="docutils literal">cargo</code>, which ships with the standard distribution of Rust, handles dependencies, builds, running code and tests, as well as publishing your stuff to a registry.</p>
</section>
<section id="are-those-ecosystems-tools-perfect">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#toc-entry-19" role="doc-backlink">Are those ecosystems’ tools perfect?</a></h2>
<p>Not always, they have their deficiencies as well. In the Node ecosystem, packages may execute arbitrary code on install, which can be a security risk (there are some known examples, like a npm package <a class="reference external" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/03/sabotage-code-added-to-popular-npm-package-wiped-files-in-russia-and-belarus/">wiping hard drives in Russia and Belarus</a>, or another one <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/11/hacker-backdoors-widely-used-open-source-software-to-steal-bitcoin/">stealing <s>imaginary Internet money</s> Bitcoin</a>). Binary packages are not distributed on the npm registry directly, they’re either built with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">node-gyp</span></code>, or have prebuilt packages downloaded via <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">node-pre-gyp</span></code> (which is a third-party tool).</p>
<p>In the .NET ecosystem, the tools also create an <code class="docutils literal">obj</code> directory with temporary files. Those temporary files are tied to the environment they’re running in, and while the tooling will usually re-create them if something changes, it can sometimes fail and leave you with confusing errors (which can generally be solved by removing the <code class="docutils literal">bin</code> and <code class="docutils literal">obj</code> directories). If a package depends on native code (which is not already available on the target OS as part of a shared library), it must include binary builds in the NuGet package for all the platforms it supports, as there is <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/9631">no standard way</a> to allow building something from source.</p>
<p>You can also find deficiencies in the tools for the other languages mentioned. Some people think Maven is terrible because it uses XML and Gradle is the way to go, and others think Gradle’s use of a Groovy-based DSL makes things much harder than they need to be and prefer Maven instead.</p>

<section id="pep-582-the-future-of-python-packaging">
<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#toc-entry-20" role="doc-backlink">PEP 582: the future of Python packaging?</a></h1>
<p>Recall that when introducing PDM, I mentioned <a class="reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0582/">PEP 582</a>. This PEP defines a <code class="docutils literal">__pypackages__</code> directory. This directory would be taken into consideration by Python when looking for imports. It would behave similarly to <code class="docutils literal">node_modules</code>. Since there will be no symlinks to the system Python, it will resolve the issues with moving the virtual environment. Because the packages live in the project, there is no problem with sharing a project directory between multiple system users. It might even be possible for different computers (but with the same Python version and OS) to share the <code class="docutils literal">__pypackages__</code> directory (in some specific cases). The proposed <code class="docutils literal">__pypackages__</code> directory structure has <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">lib/python3.10/site-packages/</span></code> subfolders, which still makes the “reinstall on Python upgrade” step mandatory, but it doesn’t apply to minor version upgrades, and if you’re dealing with a pure-Python dependency tree, <code class="docutils literal">mv __pypackages__/lib/python3.10 __pypackages__/lib/python3.11</code> might just work. This structure does make sense for binary dependencies, or for dependencies necessary only on older Python versions, as it allows you to use multiple Python versions with the same project directory. The PEP does not say anything about sharing <code class="docutils literal">__pypackages__</code> between projects, but you could probably solve that problem with symlinks (assuming the tooling doesn’t care if the directory is a symlink, and it shouldn’t care IMO).</p>
<p>While PEP 582 is a great vision, and it would simplify many package-related workflows, it hasn’t seen much care from the powers-that-be. The PEP was proposed in May 2018, and there’s even <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/kushaldas/pep582/blob/main/pep582.py">a usable implementation</a> that’s less than 50 lines of code, there <a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-582-python-local-packages-directory/963/">hasn’t been much progress</a> on having it accepted and implemented in Python proper. However, PDM does not care, and it allows you to enable the future on your own machine.</p>

<p>Well, almost. There are two things that I have complaints about. The first one is the <code class="docutils literal">pdm <span class="pre">--pep582</span></code> hack, but hopefully, the PyPA gets its act together and gets it into Python core soon. However, another important problem is the lack of separation from system site-packages. Avid readers of footnotes <a class="brackets" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#footnote-6" id="footnote-reference-6" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>6<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> might have noticed I had to use a Docker container in my PDM experiments, because requests is very commonly found in system <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">site-packages</span></code> (especially when using system Pythons, which have requests because of some random package, or because it was unbundled from pip). <a class="brackets" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#footnote-7" id="footnote-reference-7" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>7<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> This can break things in ways you don’t expect, because you might end up importing and depending on system-wide things, or mixing system-wide and local packages (if you don’t install an extra requirement, but those packages are present system-wide, then you might end up using an extra you haven’t asked for). This is an important problem—a good solution would be to disable system site-packages if a <code class="docutils literal">__pypackages__</code> directory is in use.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#toc-entry-23" role="doc-backlink">The part where the Steering Council kills it</a></h2>
<p>In late March 2023, the Python Steering Council has announced <a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-582-python-local-packages-directory/963/430">the rejection of PEP 582</a>. The reasons cited in the SC decision cited the limitations of the PEP (the <code class="docutils literal">__pypackages__</code> directory not always being enough, and the lack of specification on how it would behave in edge cases). Another argument is that it is possible to get <code class="docutils literal">__pypackages__</code> via “one of the many existing customization mechanisms for <code class="docutils literal">sys.path</code>, like <code class="docutils literal">.pth</code> files or a <code class="docutils literal">sitecustomize</code> module” — things commonly considered hacks, not real solutions. While users certainly can do anything they want to the <code class="docutils literal">sys.path</code> (often with tragic consequences), the point of having a common standard is to encourage tools to add support for it — if you use the aforementioned hacks, your IDE might end up not noticing the packages or considering them part of your code (trying to index them and search for things in them). Another reason cited for the rejection is the disagreement among the packaging community, which should not be surprising, especially in light of the next section.</p>
<p>The PEP 582/<code class="docutils literal">__pypackages__</code> mechanism may become official one day, and finally make Python packaging approachable. That would probably require someone to step up and write a new PEP that would make more people happy. Or Python might be stuck with all these incompatible tools, and invent 10 more in the next few years. (PDM is still there, and it still supports <code class="docutils literal">__pypackages__</code>, even though its implementation isn’t exactly the same as suggested by the now-rejected PEP.) Python’s current trajectory, as demonstrated by this decision, and by many people still being forced to struggle with the needlessly complicated virtual environments, sounds an awful lot like <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27No_Way_to_Prevent_This,%27_Says_Only_Nation_Where_This_Regularly_Happens">the classic Onion headline</a>: ‘No Way to Prevent This,’ Says Only Programming Community Where This Regularly Happens.</p>

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#toc-entry-24" role="doc-backlink">PyPA versus reality: packaging survey results and PyPA reaction</a></h1>
<p>Some time ago, the PSF ran a survey on packaging. Over 8000 people responded. <a class="reference external" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U5d5SiXLVkzDpS0i1dJIA4Hu5Qg704T9/view">The users have spoken:</a></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Most people think packaging is too complex.</p></li>
<li><p>An overwhelming majority prefers using just a single tool.</p></li>
<li><p>Most people also think the existence of multiple tools is not beneficial for the Python packaging ecosystem.</p></li>
<li><p>Virtually everyone would prefer a clearly defined official workflow.</p></li>
<li><p>Over 50% of responses think tools for other ecosystems are better at managing dependencies and installing packages.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The next step after this survey was for the packaging community to <a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/python-packaging-strategy-discussion-part-1/22420">discuss its results</a> and try to come up with a new packaging strategy. The first post from Shamika Mohanan (the Packaging Project Manager at PSF) that triggered the discussion also focused heavily on the users’ vision to unify packaging tools and to have One True Tool. This discussion was open to people involved with the packaging world; many participants of the discussion are involved with PyPA, and I don’t think I’ve seen a single comment from the people behind Poetry or PDM.</p>
<p>Most of the thread ended up being discussion of binary extensions, including discussions of how to help tool proliferation by making it possible for tools that aren’t setuptools to build binary extensions. There was also a lot of focus on the scientific community’s issues with <a class="reference external" href="https://pypackaging-native.github.io/">libraries with native code</a>, heavily rooted in C/C++, and with attempts to replace Conda with new PyPA-approved tools. The “unified tool” for everyone else was mentioned in some posts, but they were certainly the minority.</p>
<p>Some PyPA members talked about a UX analysis, and that they expect the unified tool to be re-exporting functionality from existing tools—which immediately raises the question: which tools should it export functionality from and why? Is <code class="docutils literal">pip install <span class="pre">unified-packaging-tool</span></code> going to bring in all fourteen? Is the fact that users are unhappy with what they have, and many of them would be happy with something lke npm/dotnet/cargo, not enough to determine the UX direction of the unified tool?</p>
<p>Some of them are also against breaking existing workflows. Is a unified packaging tool going to work for every single user? Definitely not. But are there that many distinct basic workflows? If we ignore things that border on bikeshedding, such as src vs no-src, or venv locations, are there that many workflows to consider? Someone making a library and someone making an application do have different needs (e.g. with regard to publishing the package or acceptable dependency versions). Someone working with C extensions (or extensions using something like Cython) may have different needs, but their needs would usually be a superset of the needs of someone working on a pure-Python project. The scientific community might have more specialized needs, related to complex non-Python parts, but I am positive many of their points could be solved by the unified tool as well, even if it’s not by the time this tool reaches v1.0. It is also possible that the scientific community might prefer to stay with Conda, or with some evolution of it that brings it closer in line with the Unified Packaging Tool but also solves the scientists’ needs better than a tool also solving the non-scientists’ needs can.</p>
<p>Then there’s a discussion about the existing tools and which one is the tool for the future. The maintainer of Hatch (Ofek Lev) says that <a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/python-packaging-strategy-discussion-part-1/22420/4">Hatch can provide the “unified UX”</a>. But do the maintainers of Poetry or PDM agree? Poetry seems to be far more active than Hatch, going by GitHub issues, and it’s also worth noting that Hatch’s bus factor is 1 (with Ofek Lev responsible for 542 out of 576 commits to the master branch). <a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/python-packaging-strategy-discussion-part-1/22420/46">Russell Keith-Magee from BeeWare</a> has highlighted the fact that tooling aside, the PyPA does a bad job at communicating things. Russell mentioned that one of PyPA tutorials now uses Hatch, but there is no way to know if the PyPA considers Hatch to be the future, are people supposed to migrate onto Hatch, and is Flit, another recent PyPA tool, now useless? Russell also makes good points about focusing efforts: should people focus on helping Hatch support extension modules (which, according to the Hatch maintainer, is the last scenario requiring setuptools; other participants note that you can already build native code without setuptools), or should people focus on improving setuptools compatibility with PEP 517?</p>
<p>There were also some people stating their opinions on unifying things in various ways—and many of them are <a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/python-packaging-strategy-discussion-part-1/22420/136">against</a> <a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/python-packaging-strategy-discussion-part-1/22420/137">unifying</a> things. There were some voices of reason, like that of Russell Keith-Magee, or of <a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/python-packaging-strategy-discussion-part-1/22420/140">Simon Notley</a>, who correctly noticed the thread fails to resolve problems of developers, who are confused about packaging, and don’t understand the different choices available and how they interoperate. Simon does agree that native dependencies are important and happen often in Python projects (and so do I), but the users who responded to the survey had something else in mind — as exemplified by the discussion opening post, mentioning the user expecting the simplicity of Rust’s cargo, and by the survey results. 70% of the survey respondents also use <code class="docutils literal">npm</code>, so many Python users have already seen the simpler workflows. The survey respondents were also asked to rank a few focus areas based on importance. “Making Python packaging better serve common use cases and workflows” was ranked first out of the provided options <a class="brackets" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#footnote-8" id="footnote-reference-8" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>8<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> by 3248 participants. “Supporting a wider range of use cases (e.g. edge cases, etc.)” was ranked first by 379 people, and it was the least important in the minds of 2989 people.</p>
<p>One more point that highlights the detachment of packaging folk from reality was mentioned by Anderson Bravalheri. To Anderson, a new unified tool would be <a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/python-packaging-strategy-discussion-part-1/22420/133">disrespectful of the work</a> the maintainers of the existing tools put into maintaining them, and disrespectful of users who had to adapt to the packaging mess. This point is completely absurd. Was the replacement of MS-DOS/Windows 9x and Classic Mac OS with Windows NT and <s>Mac OS X</s> <s>OS X</s> macOS disrespectful to their respective designers, and the users who had to adapt to manually configuring minutiae, figuring out how to get all your software and hardware to run with weird limitations that were necessary in the 1980s, and the system crashing every once in a while? Was the replacement of horses with cars disrespectful to horses, and the people who were removing horse manure from the streets? Was the replacement of the Ford Model T with faster, safer, more efficient, and easier to use cars disrespectful to Henry Ford? Technology comes and goes, and sometimes, getting an improvement means we need to get rid of the old stuff. This applies outside of technology, too—you could come up with many examples of change in the world, which might have put some people out of power, but has greatly improved the lives of millions of people (the fall of communism in Europe, for example). Also, going back to the technology world of today, this sentiment suggests Anderson is far too attached to the software they write—is this a healthy approach?</p>
<p>Nobody raised PEP 582 or the complexity of virtual environments. It might not be visible from the ivory towers of packaging tool maintainers, who have years of experience dealing with them, but it certainly does exist for regular people, for people who think the Python provided by their Linux distro is good enough, and especially for people for whom Python is their introduction to programming.</p>
<p>I would like to once again highlight: that’s not just the opinion of one random rambling Chris. The opinion that Python packaging needs to be simplified and unified is held by about half of the 8774 people who took the survey.</p>
<p>But here’s one more interesting thing: Discourse, the platform that the discussion was held on, shows the number of times a link was clicked. Granted, this count might not be always accurate, but if we assume it is, the link to the results summary was clicked only 14 times (as of 2023-01-14 21:20 UTC). The discussion has 28 participants and 2.2k views. If we believe the link click counter, <strong>half of the discussion participants did not even bother reading what the people think</strong>.</p>

<h1><a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#toc-entry-25" role="doc-backlink">Summary</a></h1>
<p>Python packaging is a mess, and it always has been. There are tons of tools, mostly incompatible with each other, and no tool can solve <em>all</em> problems (especially no tool from the PyPA). PDM is really close to the ideal, since it can do away with the overhead of managing virtual environments—which is hopefully the future of Python packaging, or the 2010s of Node.js packaging (although it is not going to be the 2023 of Python packaging, considering the Steering Council rejection). Perhaps in a few years, Python developers (and more importantly, Python learners!) will be able to just <code class="docutils literal">pip install</code> (or <code class="docutils literal">pdm install</code>?) what they need, without worrying about some “virtual environment” thing, that is separate but not quite from a system Python, and that is not a virtual machine. Python needs less tools, not more.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carthago_delenda_est">Furthermore, I consider that the PyPA must be destroyed.</a> The strategy discussion highlights the fact that they are unable to make Python packaging work the way the users expect. The PyPA should focus on producing one good tool, and on getting PEP 582 into Python. A good way to achieve this would be to put its resources behind PDM. The issues with native code and binary wheels are important, but plain-Python workflows, or workflows with straightforward binary dependencies, are much more common, and need to be improved. This improvement needs to happen now.</p>

<p>Funnily enough, the aphorism itself fails at “one obvious way to do it”. It is with dashes set in two different ways (with spaces after but not before, and with spaces before but not after), and none of them is the correct one (most English style guides prefer no spaces, but some allow spaces on both sides).</p>

<p>There’s a new major version of .NET every year, with the even-numbered versions being LTS. Those are far less revolutionary than the Python 2 → 3 transition, and after you jump on the modern .NET train, upgrading a project to the new major version is fairly simple (possibly even just bumping the version number).</p>

<p>Also, why is there no good HTTP client library in Python’s standard library? Is the “standard library is where packages go to die” argument still relevant, if requests had four releases in 2022, and urllib3 had six, and most of the changes were minor?</p>

<p>HTML 5.0 was finalized in 2014 (and its drafts were published even earlier), and with it came the <code class="docutils literal">&lt;datalist&gt;</code> element.  It’s
2020, and even though it might look like a good replacement for custom
autocomplete widgets, browser issues made me get rid of it.</p>



<p>I’ve built a web app to help me track my expenses. The app is written in Django,
and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Kwpolska/django-expenses">it’s open source</a>. One of
the goals was to have a simple codebase with limited external JS dependencies,
as well as basic usability with JS disabled. This is partially to facilitate
learning of standard DOM manipulation routines and TypeScript.</p>
<p>The JS/TS bits are called the <em>Scripting Enhancements</em> to reflect their nature.
The biggest items are an interactive bill editor (a table with add/edit/remove
operations, that submits its data as a regular HTML POST <code class="docutils literal">&lt;form&gt;</code>) and an
autocomplete framework (used by the bill editor in an advanced way, and by
other screens in the app with a more basic featureset). The autocomplete
framework is exactly what you’d expect: point it at an input field and a URL,
and keypresses lead to the URL being queried for previous values for this
field, which are displayed as possible values to the user to save typing.</p>
<section id="autocomplete-with-html-5-the-datalist-tag">
<h1>Autocomplete with HTML 5: the &lt;datalist&gt; tag</h1>
<p>But how to display the options to the user? Most people would display a
<code class="docutils literal">position: absolute</code> box with links/buttons, throw in some more logic around
the focus and blur events, and call it a day. There are tons of ready-made
solutions that do all that for you, although most of them are terrible. But!
HTML 5 introduced a <code class="docutils literal">&lt;datalist&gt;</code> tag. And it looks like everything you could
need. You link a <code class="docutils literal">&lt;datalist&gt;</code> tag to an <code class="docutils literal">&lt;input&gt;</code> and it shows matching
options in an autocomplete-style box.  In fact, here’s a simple demo, in case
your browser supports it:</p>
<div class="card mb-3 text-center">
    <div class="card-body">
        <label for="dldemo" class="ml-1 mr-1">Favorite programming language:</label>
        <input class="form-control d-inline-block ml-1 mr-1" style="width: auto" placeholder="Start typing…" list="dldemolist" id="dldemo">
        <datalist id="dldemolist">
            <option value="Swift">
            <option value="Rust">
            <option value="Ruby">
            <option value="Python">
            <option value="PHP">
            <option value="Kotlin">
            <option value="JavaScript">
            <option value="Java">
            <option value="Go">
            <option value="C++">
            <option value="C#">C Sharp</option>
            <option value="C">
        </option></datalist>
    </div>
    <div class="card-footer"><a href="https://chriswarrick.com/listings/datalist/datalist-demo.html.html">View demo source</a></div>
</div><p>Now, here are a few takeaways from that demo:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Options are displayed in the same order as in the <code class="docutils literal">&lt;datalist&gt;</code> tag in the
source, this list was sorted reverse-alphabetically in the source, and
that’s how it appears in the source.</p></li>
<li><p>The list is filtered case-insensitively based on user-input substrings. In
Chrome, Firefox and Safari, the substring can appear at any point in the
string.  But in Edge (old Microsoft engine), it looks only at the beginning
of the string.</p></li>
<li><p>Some browsers show an arrow on the field to show the entries, sometimes
double-clicking opens the list.</p></li>
<li><p>The entry for C# is as follows: <code class="docutils literal">&lt;option <span class="pre">value=&quot;C#&quot;&gt;C</span> <span class="pre">Sharp&lt;/option&gt;</span></code>.
Chrome displays it on as <span class="raw-html">“<strong>C#</strong> <small>C
Sharp</small>”</span> (on two lines), Safari shows only “C#”, Firefox and Edge
show “C Sharp”. Selecting the option always inputs C#.</p></li>
<li><p>Mobile Safari does not expand the list by default, but displays some of the
options above the keyboard (as typing predictions). You can click on the
arrow to display all the options in a <a class="reference external" href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/controls/pickers/">scrolling picker</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Chrome on Android displays it the same way as on desktop (drop-down list).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This demo uses static, hardcoded data. Doing that for the Expenses app would
be terrible for performance — that would waste bandwidth, force the browser to
parse a fairly long list, and it could easily overload the browser when it
tries to expand the list. But wiring it up to a <code class="docutils literal">fetch()</code> call to a REST API
should not be hard, and browsers work correctly when the datalist changes.</p>
</section>
<section id="an-emoji-hack">
<h1>An emoji hack</h1>
<p>One of the features I needed was to make the auto-complete fill out more than
one field at once. Well, <code class="docutils literal">&lt;datalist&gt;</code> has no specific support for that. It only
supports showing a list and putting the value in the input box it’s connected
to. But choosing something from the list fires the usual <code class="docutils literal">input</code> event. I
opted to do this: show every entry with a sparkles emoji (✨) in front, with the
two other fields also inside this string, delimited by other emoji, and then
catch the <code class="docutils literal">input</code> event.  If the field beigns with ✨, then use a regex to go
from one emoji-delimited string to three, and place the correct strings in
three input boxes (while also removing the sparkles from the first field).</p>
<p>Yes, it’s a hack. But it’s pretty okay appearance-wise, and it does work. It
wouldn’t have worked so well in Edge, but I didn’t even know about this
behavior before writing this blog post, and the initial sparkles emoji could be
dropped and I could still make it work.</p>
</section>
<section id="works-on-mobile-yes-except">
<h1>Works on mobile? Yes, except…</h1>
<p>I went on and deployed the <code class="docutils literal">&lt;datalist&gt;</code>-based autocomplete to my site. It
looked good, worked fine. To use the thing on mobile, I’ve got a special
launcher app. Its main reason for existence? I want a home screen icon, but
Chrome only allows progressive web apps to do that (and that’s busywork I don’t
feel like doing), and back then, Firefox (which has no such restrictions) did
not support <code class="docutils literal">&lt;datalist&gt;</code> on Android.  The app is fairly simple, with a
standard WebView widget and a slide-out navigation drawer, and a few other nice
things, and it’s 120 SLOC of Kotlin.</p>
<p>But then, I bought a new phone, and with it, upgraded from Android 7 to 9. And
I hit a bug in Chrome, which is still not fixed. The bug?
<a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=949555">HTML datalist doesn’t work on Android 8 or higher in WebView</a>.</p>
<p>Oh. We’ve got a bit of a problem. Firefox still didn’t seem to support
<code class="docutils literal">&lt;datalist&gt;</code>. But there’s one more way to make an app show a webpage: Custom
Tabs. This is a feature you’ve probably seen around Android, and it’s somewhere
in between. The app gets minimum control over the appearance of the toolbar,
but the “real” web browser is responsible for rendering the page. Chrome in a
Custom Tab supports <code class="docutils literal">&lt;datalist&gt;</code>. So I built a small app to do what I wanted.</p>
<p>There was just one minor thing to fix. My default browser on mobile is <a class="reference external" href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/focus">Firefox
Focus</a>. The main features of
Focus are tracking protection, content blocking, and storing zero
history and cookies (permanent incognito mode with one-click clearing). This is
perfect for clicking random links, especially since I hate Chrome’s insistence
on showing webpages you visited 5 years ago once when autocompleting URLs.
(Chrome is my secondary browser on mobile; on desktop, I almost always have an
incognito window open.)</p>
<p>Why is Focus relevant to this story? One, it (still) does not support the tag.
Two, the default browser is also the provider of the Custom Tabs. Which is
great for my web-browsing habits, but won’t solve the problem.  Fortunately,
it’s just a one-line change to send the intent directly to Chrome. The entire
thing is less than 30 lines long. You can see the full <a class="reference external" href="https://chriswarrick.com/listings/android-chrome-custom-tabs/CustomTabsActivity.java.html">CustomTabsActivity.java</a> file, but the relevant bits are below.</p>

stuff, the emoji hack works too.</p>
<p>There was one more bug with Chrome on Android. Typing a character sometimes led to
it appearing twice: I typed <em>A</em>, the hints appeared, then the text box started
showing <em>AA</em>, and my hints disappeared. I can’t reproduce it right now, but
that also made the entire flow just annoying.</p>

<section id="aftermath">
<h1>Aftermath</h1>
<p>With all the browser bugs, support issues, and various glitches, I decided to
build an autocomplete widget of my own. I took the CSS from Bootstrap 4, and
used Popper.js to do the positioning. It looks and works better, has keyboard
support, and is definitely less hacky (the emoji is still there, because they
look good, but my entries know the original object they were made from and can
just tell the handler to use that instead of using regex). And it beats many of
the autocomplete widgets out there, because they often fail when you hold the
mouse a bit longer; also, it can reposition itself to the top if there’s more
space. All that in just 198 SLOC of TypeScript. (I also discovered a bug in my
code that made it work a bit worse, fixing it for the old implementation would
still not fix the other issues.)</p>
<p>What’s the moral of the story? Even though HTML 5 has been a standard for many
years, browser support for the new tags still seems to be an issue. And
sometimes, it’s better to just put in the extra work and build a good UI on
your own, instead of trusting the browser to do it right.</p>
<p>The same applies to other “new” HTML 5 form elements.  <code class="docutils literal">&lt;input <span class="pre">type=&quot;date&quot;&gt;</span></code>
is not supported in desktop Safari, and is fairly ugly in desktop Firefox and
Chrome.  It displays the standard OS picker on mobile, which gets you a
calendar on Android, but a <a class="reference external" href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/controls/pickers/">scrolling picker</a> on iOS.
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">datetime-local</span></code> is currently Chrome-only.  <code class="docutils literal">month</code> lets you click on a day
and end up with an entire month selected in Chrome.  A custom component with
JavaScript would be far more consistent and often easier to use.</p>

<p>This humble blog is written by an old-school developer who sometimes does web stuff. An attempt to customize the Bootstrap CSS theme requires 50 MB of node_modules, over 500 packages, and comes with a bit of frustration at stupid tools and terrible documentation.</p>



<p>You might notice that this website is based on Bootstrap. You might also notice it’s been heavily customized, especially if you’re browsing in the (currently default) Dark Mode. Back in Bootstrap v3 days, the task was accomplished by <a class="reference external" href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/customize/">a simple online tool</a> that required no local installs. Bootstrap 4 changed the landscape: now you need to manually compile Sass. Moreover, Autoprefixer is required to make the CSS usable by web browsers.</p>
<p>Now, when it comes to web development, I believe the old ways were better. Back when nobody thought to make a client-side-JS-based blog or pastebin, and only apps that needed interactivity were JS-first. Gmail is a good example of that, although they <em>still</em> offer a <a class="reference external" href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/15049?hl=en">basic HTML view</a> and it works good — in fact, I suppose it might be less buggy than the JS-ladden version. (A lot of single-page apps like to randomly glitch out in my experience.)</p>
<p>I still remember the days when all that one had to do is <code class="docutils literal">java <span class="pre">-jar</span> yuicompressor.jar style.css &gt; style.min.css</code>. Then Less and Sass became more popular — and that’s good. The ability to use variables and functions makes it possible to produce well-organized stylesheets. The idea of Autoprefixer is also fine, humans should not waste their time with browser-specific prefixes for experimental features, that can be neatly automated.</p>
<p>But to use all these fancy tools, glue code is necessary. Autoprefixer is (mainly server-side) JS-only, Sass is currently Node or Dart, minifier tools are available in many languages.</p>
<section id="attempt-0-no-js-stuff-no-node-modules">
<h1>Attempt 0: no JS stuff, no node_modules</h1>
<p>I installed a Sass compiler. There are web services like cssminifier.com that can be easily used with curl in a Bash script. Autoprefixer has a webpage that lets you use the service without installing it as well. The catch is, the code runs locally in your web browser. Automating a web browser requires some effort. I decided to leave this part un-automated. Here is the Bash script I hacked together (with some messages removed):</p>

<p>The “manual copy” solution was inconvenient, but it worked.</p>
<p>Well, most of the time Some lags/glitches with the clipboard meant that sometimes, files had the incorrect content. So, I wanted to fix it, and build it in a more modern, JS-y way. The way Bootstrap does it is a lot of shell commands (that run various Node tools). I don’t feel like building this pipeline with Bash, it would feel fragile. Let’s do it the JS way.</p>
</section>
<section id="attempt-1-webpack">
<h1>Attempt 1: webpack</h1>
<p>I’ve used webpack for <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Kwpolska/django-expenses/blob/master/ts/webpack.config.js">another project of mine</a>. It was okay, and it did the job (namely, compiling TypeScript into browser-usable JS).</p>
<p>I wanted to give it a try for this one. I googled “webpack sass”. The first result was <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader">sass-loader</a>. The pipeline for it was:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code javascript"><a id="rest_code_7bad4f65d96d4c5187951f660174631c-1" name="rest_code_7bad4f65d96d4c5187951f660174631c-1" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2019/02/15/modern-web-development-where-you-need-500-packages-to-build-bootstrap/#rest_code_7bad4f65d96d4c5187951f660174631c-1"></a><span class="s2">&quot;style-loader&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="c1">// creates style nodes from JS strings</span>

</pre></div>
<p>Let’s recap. Someone thought that the right way to do CSS is to use JS imports.</p>
<p>Yes. <code class="docutils literal">import <span class="pre">&quot;./style.css&quot;;</span></code> in a JS file. So that your fancy build tool knows about CSS.</p>
<p>Webpack wasn’t the right tool for my project, but even if I had JS code there, <strong>WHY WOULD I MENTION STYLESHEETS IN MY JS CODE?!</strong> Webpack’s website also lists .jpg and .png assets, are they meant to be imported in JS as well? This is absurd.</p>
<p>Going back to googling “webpack sass”… The next two results were Medium posts. The stupidity of Medium as a blog platform notwithstanding, one of the posts was from 2017, referring to webpack 2. The next post was a year older, a completely unreadable mess, and it was for webpack 4. That’s not helpful in any way.</p>

<section id="attempt-2-gulp">
<h1>Attempt 2: Gulp</h1>
<p>Let’s try something else from the JS world: Gulp. Now, the tool is not terrible, but it still requires a lot of dependencies.</p>
<p>The pipeline that was required for this task sounds very simple:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>bootstrap-kw{,-dark}.sass → Sass compiler → Autoprefixer → bootstrap{,-dark}.css → minify → bootstrap{,-dark}.min.css</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Gulp version is fairly simple: (I based it on examples on Gulp’s website, and pages of all my dependencies).</p>

<section id="a-node-modules-extravaganza">
<h1>A node_modules extravaganza</h1>
<p>Can you see all the <code class="docutils literal">require</code> lines at the top? Every one of them is a dependency of my build script. With the exception of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">gulp-rename</span></code>, which IMO should be a built-in part of Gulp (it’s 45 lines of code and no external dependencies), the list is sensible.</p>
<p>Well, I already mentioned the size of <code class="docutils literal">node_modules</code>: 51 MiB according to <code class="docutils literal">du</code> (size-on-disk measurement). How many packages are there?</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="545">
<li><p>Five hundred and forty-five packages.</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Whoa, when did that happen? Most of it comes from gulp/gulp-cli (384 packages), with node-sass taking the second place (177 packages). Some of those are shared between libraries, and a few more belong to the other requirements. And many of these dependencies are a disgrace to programming.</p>
<p>After a full install of my <code class="docutils literal">package.json</code>, npm says <code class="docutils literal">added 545 packages from 331 contributors and audited 10500 packages in 22.458s</code>.  I’ve implicitly agreed to licenses imposed by 331 random people. All to build some simple CSS files out of SASS.</p>
<p>Let’s go on a tour of <code class="docutils literal">node_modules</code> and see what we ended up with.</p>
<section id="polyfills-reimplementations-oh-my">
<h2>Polyfills, reimplementations, oh my!</h2>
<p>Everything I’ve installed is meant to be used on top of Node.js. Node runs on top of the V8 engine, coming from Chrome. They’ve had almost-full ES2015 (ES6) support since April 2016. And yet, my node_modules is full of small polyfills.</p>
<p>Let’s pick a random one and work back from it: <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">number-is-nan</span></code>.</p>

<p>That’s a one-liner that re-implements <code class="docutils literal">Number.isNaN</code> if it’s not available, which is, according to MDN, <a class="reference external" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/isNaN">a more robust version of the original, global
isNaN()</a>. The original function coerced everything to Number before testing, which apparently wasn’t enough. That’s what you get for using a language designed in a week. The function was added to all sane browsers and Node around 2013, the polyfill was created in 2015.</p>
<p>It was pulled in by <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">is-fullwidth-code-point</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">is-finite</span></code>, both by the same author. The latter one is especially interesting: it’s at version 1.0.2. Version 1.0.1improved the codebase from <code class="docutils literal">if (x) { return false; } return true</code> (via pull request), and version 1.0.2 replaced a manual <code class="docutils literal">val !== val</code> comparison with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">number-is-nan</span></code>. <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">number-is-nan</span></code> has 7.5 million weekly downloads, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">is-finite</span></code> has 6.7M.

<p>Every Node-based CLI tool wants to be cool. And for that, they need colors.</p>
<p>How does this work in Bash? You could use <code class="docutils literal">tput setaf XX</code>, but many people would just manually <code class="docutils literal">echo '\033[XXm'</code>, the codes are available <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#3/4_bit">in Wikipedia</a> or elsewhere.</p>
<p>How does this work in Python? There are a few libraries for this (and you can always do it manually), but the most popular one is <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/colorama/">colorama</a>. That library can even handle Windows.</p>

<li><p><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ansi-colors</span></code> seems to be another, smaller option for it, it claims to be 10-20x faster than <code class="docutils literal">chalk</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>There’s a package called <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">has-ansi</span></code> which checks if a string has ANSI escapes in it. It depends on <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ansi-regex</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Also, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">strip-ansi</span></code> also uses <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ansi-regex</span></code>. All three packages are basically one liners. One exports a regex, the other two do replacement/search with it.</p></li>
<li><p>There’s <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">wrap-ansi</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ansi-wrap</span></code>. <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">wrap-ansi</span></code> intelligently wraps a string with ANSI escapes in it.  <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ansi-wrap</span></code> takes three strings and  returns <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">'\u001b['+</span> a + 'm' + msg + '\u001b[' + b + 'm'</code> (Copyright © Jon Schlinkert, MIT license)</p></li>
<li><p>There’s also <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ansi-gray</span></code>, which calls <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ansi-wrap</span></code> with a = 90, b = 39, and a user-specified message. (Copyright © Jon Schlinkert, MIT license)</p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ansi-red</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ansi-cyan</span></code> are very similar libraries to <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ansi-gray</span></code>. Is this a joke?!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are definitely other <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ansi-$color</span></code> libraries, although they are not in my <code class="docutils literal">node_modules</code>. And probably other libraries for color support, but either they are not installed, or I haven’t managed to spot them in my <code class="docutils literal">npm list</code> output.</p>

<p><code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">is-number</span></code> is another fun library; it says <code class="docutils literal">true</code> for strings of numbers, and <code class="docutils literal">false</code> for NaN (<code class="docutils literal">typeof NaN === 'number'</code>). <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">is-even</span></code> is used by, for example, <code class="docutils literal">even</code>, which calls <code class="docutils literal">Array.filter</code> with <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">is-even</span></code> as the argument. There’s also <code class="docutils literal">odd</code>, and for some reason, the two packages are separate.</p>
<p>The checks found in <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">is-odd</span></code> make some more sense if you’re working with a dynamically-typed language where every number is a float (like JS). But you could release <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">check-odd</span></code>, which is 100x faster than <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">is-odd</span></code> (it assumes its input is correct), and exports <code class="docutils literal">function checkOdd(value) { return (value % 2) !== 0; }</code> <s>(Copyright © 2019, Chris Warrick.

<p>This clause was removed by UC Berkeley in 1999, but there is still old code that has clauses (with other names), and someone could create something with the old license. I actually found one such clause in my <code class="docutils literal">node_modules</code> (from <code class="docutils literal">bcrypt_pbkdf</code>). <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/bsd.html">NetBSD had 75 different clauses</a> in 1997. It would be fun to see figures for the Node ecosystem… or more packages with equally problematic clauses.</p>
<p>Most people aren’t aware of the licenses of their node dependencies. Going back to Colorama, I can quickly verify that Colorama has no dependencies, and itself uses the 3-clause BSD license. (That version of the license lacks the advertising clause and is considered GPL-compatible.) There is a helpful <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">license-checker</span></code> package that can tell you what licenses you have (based on the details provided in <code class="docutils literal">package.json</code>)</p>

<p>The bash script now pipes <code class="docutils literal">sass</code> output to <code class="docutils literal">node run_postcss.js <span class="pre">bootstrap(-dark)</span></code>.</p>
<p>Doing this… cost me a new dependency. Its name is <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">get-stdin</span></code>. We’ve already met its author, Sindre Sorhus. While the library has its deficiencies <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/get-stdin/issues/21">(namely, it doesn’t support reading from TTY)</a>, it’s good enough.

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>The task at hand was very simple. So was the JS code (Gulp and custom) I had to write to implement it. But underneath, there was a mess of unknown, unaudited code, duplicated libraries, and libraries created effectively to bump people’s npm download stats. There were already incidents, like <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">left-pad</span></code> (the removal of which broke Babel), or <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">event-stream</span></code> (which was taken over and modified to steal cryptocurrencies). The modern web development ecosystem is a huge mess of dependencies and one-line packages. Some of them are necessary due to the lackluster JS standard library — but some are just useless. And some of these micro-packages would be better off as larger libraries.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sure, the package count went down from the original 545 to 144. But the original point still stands: too much useless stuff.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>PS. Five of the packages (in the “large” set) had a <code class="docutils literal">.DS_Store</code> file left over. I’m wondering if there are any other files that shouldn’t be shipped with packages, lurking in <code class="docutils literal">node_modules</code> directories all over the world…</p>
<p>PPS. I’ve replaced Disqus with Isso, because it had too many advertisements. If you experience any issues with the comment system (after force-refreshing), e-mail me.</p>
