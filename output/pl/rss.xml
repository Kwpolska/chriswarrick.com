Here’s a list of things that might be useful to keep in mind before, during, and after a migration of a server that hosts publicly accessible Web sites and applications, as well as other personal services, and how to get rid of the most annoying parts of Ubuntu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why switch?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fedora is a relatively popular distro, so it’s well supported by software vendors. Its packagers adopt a no-nonsense approach, making very little changes that deviate from the upstream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu is not my favorite distro, far from it. While it is perhaps the most popular distro out there, its packages contain many more patches compared to Fedora, and Canonical (the company behind Ubuntu) are famous for betting on the wrong horse (Unity, upstart, Mir…). But one thing Ubuntu does well is stability. Fedora makes releases every 6 months, and those releases are supported for just 13 months, which means upgrading at least every year. Every upgrade may introduce incompatibilities, almost every upgrade requires recreating Python venvs. That gets boring fast, and it does not necessarily bring benefits. Granted, the Fedora system upgrade works quite well, and I upgraded through at least eight releases without a re-install, but I would still prefer to avoid it. That’s why I went with Ubuntu LTS, which is supported for five years, with a new release every two years, but which still comes with reasonably new software (and with many third-party repositories if something is missing or outdated).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Test your backups&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a backup “system” that’s a bunch of Bash scripts. After upgrading one of the services that is being backed up, the responsible script started crashing, and thus backups stopped working. Another thing that broke was e-mails from cron, so I didn’t know anything was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I do have full disk backups enabled at &lt;a href="https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=Qy1lehF8PwzP"&gt;Hetzner&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;(disclaimer: referral link)&lt;/em&gt;, my custom backups are more fine-grained (e.g. important configuration files, database dumps, package lists), so they are quite useful in migrating between OSes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, here’s a reminder not only to test your backups regularly, but also to make sure they are being created at all, and to make sure cron can send you logs somewhere you can see them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonus cron tip: set &lt;code&gt;MAILFROM=&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;MAILTO=&lt;/code&gt; in your crontab if your SMTP server does not like the values cron uses by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Think about IP address reassignment (or pray to the DNS gods)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new VPS or cloud server probably means a new IP address. But if you get a new IP address, that might complicate the migration of your publicly accessible applications. If you’re proxying all your Web properties through Cloudflare or something similar, that’s probably not an issue. But if you have a raw A record somewhere, things can get complicated. DNS servers and operating systems do a lot of caching. The conventional wisdom is to wait 24 or even 48 hours after changing DNS values. This might be true if your TTL is set to a long value, but if your TTL is short, the only worry are DNS servers that ignore TTL values and cache records for longer. If you plan a migration, it’s good to check your TTL well in advance, and not worry too much about broken DNS servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you might not need a new IP. Carefully review your cloud provider’s IP management options before making any changes. Hetzner is more flexible than other hosts in this regard, as it is possible to &lt;a href="https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/servers/primary-ips/faq"&gt;move primary public IP addresses (not “floating” or “elastic” IPs) between servers&lt;/a&gt;, as long as you’re okay with a few minutes’ downtime (you will need to shut down the source and destination servers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re not okay with any downtime, you would probably want to leverage the floating/elastic IP feature, or hope DNS propagates quickly enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trim the fat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My VPS ran a lot of services I don’t need anymore, but never really got around to decommissioning. For example, I had a full Xfce install with VNC access (the VNC server was only running when needed). I haven’t actually used the desktop for ages, so I just dropped it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also had an OpenVPN setup. It was useful years ago, when mobile data allowances were much smaller and speeds much worse. These days, I don’t use public WiFi networks at all, unless I’m going abroad, and I just buy one month of &lt;a href="https://mullvad.net/"&gt;Mullvad VPN&lt;/a&gt; for €5 whenever that happens. So, add another service to the “do not migrate” list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that I could not just remove was the e-mail server. Many years ago, I ran a reasonably functional e-mail server on my VPS. I’ve since then migrated to &lt;a href="https://www.zoho.com/mail/"&gt;Zoho Mail&lt;/a&gt; (which costs €10.80/year), in part due to IP reputation issues after changing hosting providers, and also to avoid having to fight spam. When I did that, I kept Postfix around, but as a local server for things like cron or Django to send e-mail with, and I configured it to send all e-mails via Zoho. But I did not really want to move over all the configuration, hoping that Ubuntu’s Postfix packages can work with my hacked together config from Fedora. So I replaced the server with &lt;a href="https://www.opensmtpd.org/"&gt;OpenSMTPD&lt;/a&gt; (from the OpenBSD project), and all the Postfix configuration files with just one short configuration file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;table aliases file:/etc/aliases
table secrets file:/etc/mail-secrets

listen on localhost
listen on 172.17.0.1 # Docker

action "relay" relay host smtp+tls://smtp@smtp.example.net:587 auth &amp;lt;secrets&amp;gt; mail-from "@example.com"

match from any for any action "relay"
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Dockerize everything…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My server runs a few different apps, some of which are exposed on the public Internet, while some do useful work in the background. The services I have set up most recently are containerized with the help of Docker. The only Docker-based service that was stateful (and did not just use folders mounted as volumes) was a MariaDB database. Migrating that is straightforward with a simple dump-and-restore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, not everything on my server is in Docker. The public-facing nginx install isn’t, and neither is PostgreSQL (but that was also a quick dump-and-restore migration with some extra steps).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;…especially Python&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, there are the Python apps. Python the language is cool (if a little slow), but the packaging story is a &lt;a href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/"&gt;total&lt;/a&gt; dumpster &lt;a href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2024/01/15/python-packaging-one-year-later/"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, here’s a quick recap of 2024/2025 in Python packaging: the most hyped Python package manager (&lt;code&gt;uv&lt;/code&gt;) is written in Rust, which screams “Python is a toy language in which you can’t even write a tool as simple as a package manager”. (I know, dependency resolution is computationally expensive, so doing &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; in Rust makes sense, but everything else could easily be done in pure Python. And no, the package manager should not manage Python installs.) Of course, almost all the other contenders listed in my 2023 post are still being developed. On the standards front, the community finally produced a lockfile standard after years of discussions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I have three Python apps. One of them is &lt;a href="https://isso-comments.de/"&gt;Isso&lt;/a&gt;, which is providing the comments box below this post. I used to run a modified version of Isso a long time ago, but I don’t need to anymore. I looked at the docs, and they offer &lt;a href="https://isso-comments.de/docs/reference/installation/#using-docker"&gt;a pre-built Docker image&lt;/a&gt;, which means I could just quickly deploy it on my server with Docker and skip the pain of managing Python environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other two apps are Django projects built by yours truly. They are not containerized, they exist in venvs created using the system Python. Moving venvs between machines is generally impossible, so I had to re-create them. Of course, I hit a deprecation, because the Python maintainers (especially in the packaging world) does not understand their responsibility as maintainers of the most popular programming language. This time, it was caused by &lt;a href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/11457"&gt;an old editable install with setuptools (using setup.py develop, not PEP 660)&lt;/a&gt;, and installs with more recent pip/setuptools versions would not have this error… although &lt;a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/do-we-want-to-keep-the-build-system-default-for-pyproject-toml/104759"&gt;some people want to remove the fallback to setuptools if there is no pyproject.toml&lt;/a&gt;, so you need to stay up to date with the whims of the Python packaging industry if you want to use Python software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Don’t bother with ufw&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu ships with &lt;code&gt;ufw&lt;/code&gt;, the “uncomplicated firewall”, in the default install. I was previously using &lt;code&gt;firewalld&lt;/code&gt;, a Red Hat-adjacent project, but I decided to give ufw a try. Since if it’s part of the default install, it might be supported better by the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that Docker and ufw &lt;a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/packet-filtering-firewalls/#docker-and-ufw"&gt;don’t play together&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://github.com/chaifeng/ufw-docker?tab=readme-ov-file#solving-ufw-and-docker-issues"&gt;Someone has built a set of rules that are supposed to fix it&lt;/a&gt;, but that did not work for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Docker &lt;a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/packet-filtering-firewalls/#integration-with-firewalld"&gt;does integrate with firewalld&lt;/a&gt;, and Ubuntu has packages for it, so I just installed it, enabled the services that need to be publicly available and things were working again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update (2025-11-23):&lt;/em&gt; The iptables integration was not very stable on my Ubuntu system, so I disabled the iptables integration and switched to &lt;a href="https://dev.to/soerenmetje/how-to-secure-a-docker-host-using-firewalld-2joo"&gt;a simpler config in firewalld only&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kill the ads (and other nonsense too)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red Hat makes money by selling a stable OS with at least 10 years of support to enterprises, and their free offering is Fedora, with just 13 months of support; RHEL releases are branched off from Fedora. SUSE also sells SUSE Linux Enterprise and has openSUSE as the free offering (but the relationship between the paid and free version is more complicated).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu chose a different monetization strategy: the enterprise offering is the same OS as the free offering, but it gets extra packages and extra updates. The free OS advertises the paid services. It is fairly simple to get rid of them all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;sudo apt autoremove ubuntu-pro-client
sudo chmod -x /etc/update-motd.d/*
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, Ubuntu installs snap by default. Snap is a terrible idea. Luckily, there are no snaps installed by default on a Server install, so we can just remove &lt;code&gt;snapd&lt;/code&gt;. We’ll also remove &lt;code&gt;lxd-installer&lt;/code&gt; to save ~25 kB of disk space, since the installer requires snap, and lxd is another unsuccessful Canonical project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;sudo apt autoremove snapd lxd-installer
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The cost of downgrading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going from Fedora 42 (April 2025) to Ubuntu 24.04 (April 2024) means some software will be downgraded in the process. In general, this does not matter, as most software does not mind downgrades as much. One notable exception is WeeChat, the IRC client, whose config files are versioned, and Ubuntu’s version is not compatible with the one in Fedora. But here’s where Ubuntu’s popularity shines: &lt;a href="https://weechat.org/download/debian/"&gt;WeeChat has its own repositories for Debian and Ubuntu&lt;/a&gt;, so I could just get the latest version without building it myself or trying to steal packages from a newer version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than WeeChat, I haven’t experienced any other issues with software due to a downgrade. Some of it is luck (or not using new/advanced features), some of it is software caring about backwards compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was it worth it? Time will tell. Upgrading Fedora itself was not that hard, and I expect Ubuntu upgrades to be OK too — the annoying part was cleaning up and getting things to work after the upgrade, and the switch means I will have to do it only every 2-4 years instead of every 6-12 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The switchover took a few hours, especially since I didn’t have much up-to-date documentation of what is actually installed and running, and there are always the minor details where distros differ that may require adjusting to. I think a migration like this is worth trying if rolling-release or frequently-released distros are too unstable for your needs.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2025/11/09/distro-hopping-server-edition/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 09 Nov 2025 18:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>PowerShell: the object-oriented shell you didn’t know you needed</title><link>https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2024/04/29/powershell-the-object-oriented-shell-you-didnt-know-you-needed/</link><dc:creator>Chris Warrick</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;PowerShell is an interactive shell and scripting language from Microsoft. It’s object-oriented — and that’s not just a buzzword, that’s a big difference to how the standard Unix shells work. And it is actually usable as an interactive shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PowerShell is so nice, Microsoft made it twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, there concurrently exist two products named PowerShell:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Windows PowerShell (5.1) is a built-in component of Windows. It is proprietary, Windows-only, and is based on the equally proprietary and equally Windows-only .NET Framework 4.x. It has a blue icon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PowerShell (7.x), formerly known as PowerShell Core, is a stand-alone application. It is MIT-licensed &lt;a href="https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell"&gt;(developed on GitHub)&lt;/a&gt;, available for Windows, Linux, and macOS, and is based on the equally MIT-licensed and equally multi-platform .NET (formerly .NET Core). It has a black icon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows PowerShell development stopped when PowerShell (Core) came out. There are some niceties and commands missing in it, but it is still a fine option for trying it out or for when one can’t install PowerShell on a Windows system but need to solve something with code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All examples in this post should work in either version of PowerShell on any OS (unless explicitly noted otherwise).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install the modern PowerShell: &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.4"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-linux?view=powershell-7.4"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-linux?view=powershell-7.4"&gt;macOS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Objects? In my shell?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s try getting a directory listing. This is Microsoft land, so let’s try the DOS command for a directory listing — that would be &lt;code&gt;dir&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;PS &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tmp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;dir&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;Directory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tmp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;Mode&lt;/span&gt;                 &lt;span class="n"&gt;LastWriteTime&lt;/span&gt;         &lt;span class="n"&gt;Length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;----&lt;/span&gt;                 &lt;span class="p"&gt;-------------&lt;/span&gt;         &lt;span class="p"&gt;------&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;----&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;----&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class="n"&gt;2024&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;04&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;29&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;                &lt;span class="n"&gt;world&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;-a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class="n"&gt;2024&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;04&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;29&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;             &lt;span class="n"&gt;23&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;example&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;py&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;-a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class="n"&gt;2024&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;04&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;29&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;              &lt;span class="n"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;foobar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;txt&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;-a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class="n"&gt;2024&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;04&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;29&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;             &lt;span class="n"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;helloworld&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;txt&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;-a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class="n"&gt;2024&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;04&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;29&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;              &lt;span class="n"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;newfile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;txt&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;-a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class="n"&gt;2024&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;04&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;29&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;              &lt;span class="n"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;txt&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This looks like a typical (if slightly verbose) file listing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s try to do something useful with this. Let’s get the total size of all &lt;code&gt;.txt&lt;/code&gt; files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a Unix shell, one option is &lt;code&gt;du -bc *.txt&lt;/code&gt;. The arguments: &lt;code&gt;-b&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;--bytes&lt;/code&gt;) gives the real byte size, and &lt;code&gt;-c&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;--summarize&lt;/code&gt;) produces a total. The result is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;foobar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;txt&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;helloworld&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;txt&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;txt&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;txt&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;26&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kr"&gt;to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tal&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how to get just the number? This requires text manipulation (getting the first word of the last line). Something like &lt;code&gt;du -bc *.txt | tail -n 1 | cut -f 1&lt;/code&gt; will do. There’s also &lt;code&gt;wc --total=only --bytes *.txt&lt;/code&gt; — but this is specific to GNU wc, so it won’t cut it on *BSD or macOS. Another option would be to parse the output of &lt;code&gt;ls -l&lt;/code&gt; — but that might not always be easy, and the output may contain something unexpected added by the specific &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; version or the user’s specific shell configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s try something in PowerShell. If we do &lt;code&gt;$x = dir&lt;/code&gt;, we’ll have the output of the &lt;code&gt;dir&lt;/code&gt; command in &lt;code&gt;$x&lt;/code&gt;. Let’s try to analyse it further, is the first character a newline?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;PS &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tmp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;dir&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;PS &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tmp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;Directory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tmp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;Mode&lt;/span&gt;                 &lt;span class="n"&gt;LastWriteTime&lt;/span&gt;         &lt;span class="n"&gt;Length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;----&lt;/span&gt;                 &lt;span class="p"&gt;-------------&lt;/span&gt;         &lt;span class="p"&gt;------&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;----&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;----&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class="n"&gt;2024&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;04&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;29&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;                &lt;span class="n"&gt;world&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s interesting, we didn’t get the first character or the first line, we got the first &lt;em&gt;file&lt;/em&gt;. And if we try &lt;code&gt;$x[1]&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;PS &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tmp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class="n"&gt;Directory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tmp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;Mode&lt;/span&gt;                 &lt;span class="n"&gt;LastWriteTime&lt;/span&gt;         &lt;span class="n"&gt;Length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;----&lt;/span&gt;                 &lt;span class="p"&gt;-------------&lt;/span&gt;         &lt;span class="p"&gt;------&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;----&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;-a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;---&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class="n"&gt;2024&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;04&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;29&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="n"&gt;18&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;             &lt;span class="n"&gt;23&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;example&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;py&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if we try getting the &lt;code&gt;Length&lt;/code&gt; property out of that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;PS &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tmp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;].&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Length&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;23&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that &lt;code&gt;dir&lt;/code&gt; returns an array of objects, and PowerShell knows how to format this array (and a single item from the array) into a nice table. What can we do with it? This:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;PS &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tmp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Get-ChildItem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;-Filter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'*.txt'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;ForEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;-Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Measure-Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;-Sum&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;Count&lt;/span&gt;             &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Average&lt;/span&gt;           &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Sum&lt;/span&gt;               &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;26&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Maximum&lt;/span&gt;           &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Minimum&lt;/span&gt;           &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;StandardDeviation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Property&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nb"&gt;PS &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tmp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Get-ChildItem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;-Filter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'*.txt'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;ForEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;-Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Measure-Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;-Sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Sum&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;26&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;PS &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tmp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Get-ChildItem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;-Filter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'*.txt'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Measure-Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;-Sum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;-Property&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Sum&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;26&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;PS &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tmp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Get-ChildItem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;-Recurse&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;-Filter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'*.txt'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Measure-Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;-Sum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;-Property&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Sum&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;PS &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tmp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$measured&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Get-ChildItem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;-Recurse&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;-Filter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'*.txt'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Measure-Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;-Sum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;-Property&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;PS &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tmp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$measured&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Sum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$measured&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Count&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can iterate over all file objects, get their length (using &lt;code&gt;ForEach-Object&lt;/code&gt; and a lambda), and then use &lt;code&gt;Measure-Object&lt;/code&gt; to compute the sum (&lt;code&gt;Measure-Object&lt;/code&gt; returns an object, we need to get its &lt;code&gt;Sum&lt;/code&gt; property). We can replace the &lt;code&gt;ForEach-Object&lt;/code&gt; call with the &lt;code&gt;-Property&lt;/code&gt; argument in &lt;code&gt;Measure-Object&lt;/code&gt;. And if we want to look into subdirectories, we can easily add &lt;code&gt;-Recurse&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Get-ChildItem&lt;/code&gt;. We get actual integers we can do math on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might have noticed I used &lt;code&gt;Get-ChildItem&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;dir&lt;/code&gt; in the previous example. &lt;code&gt;Get-ChildItem&lt;/code&gt; is the full name of the command (&lt;em&gt;cmdlet&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;code&gt;dir&lt;/code&gt; is one of its aliases, alongside &lt;code&gt;gci&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; (Windows-only to avoid shadowing &lt;code&gt;/bin/ls&lt;/code&gt;). Many common commands have aliases defined for easier typing and ease of use — &lt;code&gt;Copy-Item&lt;/code&gt; can be written as &lt;code&gt;cp&lt;/code&gt; (for compatibility with Unix), &lt;code&gt;copy&lt;/code&gt; (for compatibility with MS-DOS), and &lt;code&gt;ci&lt;/code&gt;. In our examples, we could also use &lt;code&gt;measure&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;Measure-Object&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;foreach&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;ForEach-Object&lt;/code&gt;. Those aliases are a nice thing to have for interactive use, but for scripts, it’s best to use the full names for readability, and to avoid depending on the environment for those aliases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;More filesystem operations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Files per folder&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a photo collection in a &lt;code&gt;Photos&lt;/code&gt; folder, grouped into folders. The objective is to see how many &lt;code&gt;.jpg&lt;/code&gt; files are in each folder. Here’s the PowerShell solution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;PS &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tmp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Get-ChildItem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Photos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;/*/*.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;jpg&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Group-Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Directory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Sort-Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;-Property&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;-Descending&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt;                      &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Group&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;-----&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;----&lt;/span&gt;                      &lt;span class="p"&gt;-----&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class="n"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;bar&lt;/span&gt;                   &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tmp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Photos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;bar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;img001&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;jpg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tmp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Photos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;bar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;img002&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;jpg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tmp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Photos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;bar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;img003&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;jpg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;…&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;example&lt;/span&gt;                   &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tmp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Photos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;example&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;img101&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;jpg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tmp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Photos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;example&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;img201&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;jpg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Unix land, &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15216370/how-to-count-number-of-files-in-each-directory"&gt;StackOverflow has a lot of solutions&lt;/a&gt;. The top solution is &lt;code&gt;du -a | cut -d/ -f2 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr&lt;/code&gt; — a lot of tools mashed together, starting with a tool to check disk usage, and a lot of string manipulation. The second solution uses find, read, and shell globbing. The PowerShell solution is quite simple and obvious to anyone who has ever touched SQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above example works for one level of nesting. For more levels, given &lt;code&gt;Photos\one\two\three.jpg&lt;/code&gt;, use &lt;code&gt;Get-ChildItem -Filter '*.jpg' -Recurse Photos&lt;/code&gt;, and:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Group by &lt;code&gt;$_.Directory.Name&lt;/code&gt; (same as before) to get &lt;code&gt;two&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Group by &lt;code&gt;Split-Path -Parent ([System.IO.Path]::GetRelativePath("$PWD/Photos", $_.FullName))&lt;/code&gt; to get &lt;code&gt;one/two&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Group by &lt;code&gt;([System.IO.Path]::GetRelativePath("$PWD/Photos", $_.FullName)).Split([System.IO.Path]::DirectorySeparatorChar)[0]&lt;/code&gt; to get &lt;code&gt;one&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(All of the above examples work for a single folder as well. The latter two examples don’t work on Windows PowerShell.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Duplicate finder&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s build a simple tool to detect byte-for-byte duplicated files. &lt;code&gt;Get-FileHash&lt;/code&gt; is a shell built-in. We can use &lt;code&gt;Group-Object&lt;/code&gt; again, and &lt;code&gt;Where-Object&lt;/code&gt; to filter only matching objects. Computing the hash of every file is quite inefficient, so we’ll group by the file length first, and then ensure the hashes match. This gives us a nice pipeline of 6 commands:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# Fully spelled out&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Get-ChildItem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;-Recurse&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-File&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Group-Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Where-Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-gt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;ForEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;-Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Group &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Group-Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Get-FileHash&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;-Algorithm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;MD5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Hash&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Where-Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-gt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="p"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Count&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-gt&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Serious Scripting: Software Bill of Materials&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) and supply chain security are all the rage these days. The boss wants to have something like that, i.e. a CSV file with a list of packages and versions, and only the direct production dependencies. Sure, there exist standards like SPDX, but the boss does not like those pesky “standards”. The backend is written in C#, and the frontend is written in Node.js. Since we care only about the production dependencies, we can look at the &lt;code&gt;.csproj&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; files. For Node packages, we’ll also try to fetch the license name from the npm API (the API is a bit more complicated for NuGet, so we’ll keep it as a &lt;code&gt;TODO&lt;/code&gt; in this example).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ErrorActionPreference&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Stop"&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c"&gt;# stop execution on any error&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Set-StrictMode&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;-Version&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Get-CsprojPackages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;[string]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$Path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Select-Xml&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;-Path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$Path&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;-XPath&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'//PackageReference'&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;ForEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;-Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class="no"&gt;[PSCustomObject]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;@{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;Name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;GetAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Include"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;Version&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Node&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;GetAttribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Version"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like every well-written shell script starts with &lt;code&gt;set -euo pipefail&lt;/code&gt;, every PowerShell script should start with &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/set-strictmode?view=powershell-7.4"&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; so that execution is stopped as soon as something goes wrong. Note that this does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; affect native commands, you still need to check &lt;code&gt;$LASTEXITCODE&lt;/code&gt;. Another useful early command is &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/set-strictmode?view=powershell-7.4"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Set-StrictMode -Version 3.0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to catch undefined variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;code&gt;.csproj&lt;/code&gt; files, which are XML, we look for &lt;code&gt;PackageReference&lt;/code&gt; elements using XPath, and then build a PSCustomObject out of a hashmap — extracting the appropriate attributes from the &lt;code&gt;PackageReference&lt;/code&gt; nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;code&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;, we read the file, parse the JSON, and extract the properties of the &lt;code&gt;dependencies&lt;/code&gt; object (it’s a map of package names to versions). To get the license, we use &lt;code&gt;Invoke-RestMethod&lt;/code&gt;, which takes care of parsing JSON for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the main body of the script, we look for the appropriate files (skipping things under &lt;code&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt;) and call our parser functions. After retrieving all data, we concatenate the two arrays, convert to CSV, and use &lt;code&gt;Tee-Object&lt;/code&gt; to output to a file and to standard output. We get this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Name"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Version"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Source"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"License"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s"&gt;"AWSSDK.S3"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"3.7.307.24"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"nuget"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"TODO"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="s"&gt;"react"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"^18.3.1"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"node"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"MIT"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="s"&gt;"typescript"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"^4.9.5"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"node"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Apache-2.0"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s"&gt;"web-vitals"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"^2.1.4"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"node"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Apache-2.0"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could it be done in a different language? Certainly, but PowerShell is really easy to integrate with CI, e.g. &lt;a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#example-running-a-command-using-powershell-core"&gt;GitHub Actions&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/tasks/reference/powershell-v2?view=azure-pipelines"&gt;Azure Pipelines&lt;/a&gt;. On Linux, you might be tempted to use Python — and you could get something done equally simply, as long as you don’t mind using the ugly &lt;code&gt;urllib.request&lt;/code&gt; library, or alternatively ensuring &lt;code&gt;requests&lt;/code&gt; is installed (and then you get into the hell that is Python package management).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Using .NET classes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PowerShell is built on top of .NET. This isn’t just the implementation technology — PowerShell gives access to everything the .NET standard library offers. For example, the alternate ways to group photos in multiple subdirectories we’ve explored above involve a call to a static method of the .NET &lt;code&gt;System.IO.Path&lt;/code&gt; class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other .NET types are also available. Need a HashSet? Here goes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;PS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;New-Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Collections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Generic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HashSet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;[string]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;PS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"hello"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;PS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"hello"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;PS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"world"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Out-Null&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;PS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Count&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;PS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-contains&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"hello"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;PS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$set&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-contains&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"world"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;False&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also possible to load any .NET DLL into PowerShell (as long as it’s compatible with the .NET version PowerShell is built against) and use it as usual from C# (although possibly with slightly ugly syntax).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sick Windows Tricks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft supposedly killed off Internet Explorer last year. Attempting to launch &lt;code&gt;iexplore.exe&lt;/code&gt; will bring up Microsoft Edge. But you see, Internet Explorer is a crucial part of Windows, and has been so for over two decades. Software vendors have built software that depends on IE being there and being able to show web content. Some of them are using web views, but some of them prefer something else: COM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;COM, or Component Object Model, is Microsoft’s thing for interoperability between different applications and/or components. COM is basically a way for classes offered by different vendors and potentially written in different languages to talk to one another. Under the hood, COM is C++ &lt;code&gt;vtable&lt;/code&gt;s plus standard reference counting and class loading/discovery mechanisms. The .NET Framework, and its successor .NET, have always included COM interoperability. The modern WinRT platform is COM on steroids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming back to Internet Explorer, it exposes some COM classes. They were &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; removed with &lt;code&gt;iexplore.exe&lt;/code&gt;. This means you can bring up a regular Internet Explorer window in just two lines of PowerShell:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ie&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;New-Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;-ComObject&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;InternetExplorer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Application&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$ie&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Visible&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why would you do that? The &lt;code&gt;InternetExplorer.Application&lt;/code&gt; object lets you control the browser, e.g. you can use &lt;code&gt;$ie.Navigate("https://example.com/")&lt;/code&gt; to go to a page. Why would you want to launch IE in 2024? I don’t know, I guess you can use it to laugh in the faces of the Microsoft developers who removed the user-accessible shortcuts? But there definitely exist some legacy applications that expect a COM-controllable IE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have already explored the possibility of using classes from .NET. .NET comes with a GUI framework named Windows Forms, &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/samples/creating-a-custom-input-box?view=powershell-7.4"&gt;which can be loaded from PowerShell and used to build a GUI.&lt;/a&gt; There is no form designer, so it requires manually defining and positioning controls, but it actually works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PowerShell can also do various Windows management tasks. It can manage boot settings, BitLocker, Hyper-V, networking, storage… For example, to get the percentage of disk space remaining:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Get-Volume&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;C&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;$((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SizeRemaining&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;%"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Getting out of PowerShell land&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a shell, PowerShell can obviously launch subprocesses. Unlike something like Python, running a subprocess is as simple as running anything else. If you need to &lt;code&gt;git pull&lt;/code&gt;, you just type that. Or you can make PowerShell interact with non-PowerShell commands, reading output and passing arguments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$changes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;status&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;-porcelain&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;-null&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$LASTEXITCODE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-eq&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;128&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Not a git repository"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;elseif&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$LASTEXITCODE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-ne&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;throw&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Getting changes from git failed"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$null&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-eq&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$changes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Write-Host&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"No changes found"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$untrackedFiles&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;@(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$changes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;`0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Where-Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;StartsWith&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;'?? '&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;ForEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;-Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Remove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="c"&gt;# Alternate spelling for regex fans:&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$untrackedFilesForRegexFans&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;@(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$changes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;`0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Where-Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-match&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'^\?\? '&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;ForEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;-Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-replace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;'^\?\? '&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;''&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$untrackedFiles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Write-Host&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Opening &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$untrackedFiles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt; untracked files in VS Code"&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;code&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nv"&gt;$untrackedFiles&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="nb"&gt;Write-Host&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;"No untracked files"&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose to compute untracked files with the help of standard .NET string manipulation methods, but there’s also a regex option. On a related note, there are three content check operators: &lt;code&gt;-match&lt;/code&gt; uses regex, &lt;code&gt;-like&lt;/code&gt; uses &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_wildcards?view=powershell-7.4"&gt;wildcards&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;-contains&lt;/code&gt; checks collection membership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Profile script&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use a fairly small profile script that adds some behaviours I’m used to from Unix, and to make Tab completion show a menu. Here are the most basic bits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Set-PSReadLineOption&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;-HistorySearchCursorMovesToEnd&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Set-PSReadLineKeyHandler&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;-Key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;UpArrow&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;-Function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;HistorySearchBackward&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Set-PSReadLineKeyHandler&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;-Key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;DownArrow&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;-Function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;HistorySearchForward&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Set-PSReadlineKeyHandler&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;-Key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ctrl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;-Function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;DeleteCharOrExit&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Set-PSReadlineKeyHandler&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;-Key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Tab&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;-Function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;MenuComplete&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="nb"&gt;Set-PSReadLineOption&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;-AddToHistoryHandler&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;param&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$command&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c"&gt;# Commands starting with space are not remembered.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$command&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-like&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;' *'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from that, I use a few aliases and a pretty prompt with the help of &lt;a href="https://ohmyposh.dev/"&gt;oh-my-posh&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The unusual and sometimes confusing parts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PowerShell can be verbose. Some of its syntax is a little quirky, compared to other languages, e.g. the equality and logic operators (for example, &lt;code&gt;-eq&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-le&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-and&lt;/code&gt;). The aliases usually help with remembering commands, but they can’t always be depended on — &lt;code&gt;ls&lt;/code&gt; is defined as an alias only on Windows, and Windows PowerShell aliases &lt;code&gt;wget&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Invoke-WebRequest&lt;/code&gt;, even though all three have completely different command line arguments and outputs (this was removed in PowerShell).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the Unix/DOS aliases do not change the argument handling. &lt;code&gt;rm -rf foo&lt;/code&gt; is invalid. &lt;code&gt;rm -r foo&lt;/code&gt; is, since argument names can be abbreviated as long as the abbreviation is unambiguous. &lt;code&gt;rm -r -f foo&lt;/code&gt; is not valid, because &lt;code&gt;-f&lt;/code&gt; can be an abbreviation of &lt;code&gt;-Filter&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;-Force&lt;/code&gt; (so &lt;code&gt;rm -r -fo foo&lt;/code&gt;) will do. &lt;code&gt;rm foo bar&lt;/code&gt; does not work, an array is needed: &lt;code&gt;rm foo,bar&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;C:\Windows\regedit.exe&lt;/code&gt; launches the Registry editor. &lt;code&gt;"C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe"&lt;/code&gt; is a string. Launching something with spaces in its name requires the call operator: &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp; "C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe"&lt;/code&gt;. PowerShell’s tab completion will add the &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two function call syntaxes. Calling a function/cmdlet uses the shell-style syntax with argument names: &lt;code&gt;Some-Function -Arg1 value1 -Arg2 value2&lt;/code&gt;, and argument names can be abbreviated, and can sometimes be omitted. Calling a method requires a more traditional syntax: &lt;code&gt;$obj.SomeMethod(value1, value2)&lt;/code&gt;. Names are case-insensitive in either case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The escape character is the backtick. The backslash is the path separator in Windows, so making it an escape character would make everything painful on Windows. At least it makes it easy to write regex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The ugliest part&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ugliest and the least intuitive part of PowerShell is the handling of single-element arrays. PowerShell &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wants to unpack them to a scalar. The command &lt;code&gt;(Get-ChildItem).Length&lt;/code&gt; will produce the number of files in the current directory — &lt;em&gt;unless&lt;/em&gt; there is exactly one file, in which case it will produce the single file’s size in bytes. And if there are zero items, instead of an empty array, PowerShell produces &lt;code&gt;$null&lt;/code&gt;. Sometimes, things will work out in the end (since many cmdlets are happy to get either as inputs), but sometimes, PowerShell must be asked to stop this madness and return an array: &lt;code&gt;@(Get-ChildItem).Length&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previous example with &lt;code&gt;git status&lt;/code&gt; leverages its &lt;code&gt;--null&lt;/code&gt; argument to get zero-delimited data, so we expect either &lt;code&gt;$null&lt;/code&gt; or a single string according to the rules. If we didn’t want to use &lt;code&gt;--null&lt;/code&gt;, we would need to use &lt;code&gt;@(git status --porcelain)&lt;/code&gt; to always get an array (but we would also need to remove quotes that &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; adds to paths that contain spaces).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PowerShell is a fine interactive shell and scripting language. While it does have some warts, it is more powerful than your usual Unix shell, and its strongly-typed, object-oriented code beats &lt;em&gt;stringly-typed&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;sh&lt;/code&gt; spaghetti any day.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2024/04/29/powershell-the-object-oriented-shell-you-didnt-know-you-needed/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 29 Apr 2024 16:45:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Python Packaging, One Year Later: A Look Back at 2023 in Python Packaging</title><link>https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2024/01/15/python-packaging-one-year-later/</link><dc:creator>Chris Warrick</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;A year ago, I wrote about the sad state of Python packaging. The large number of tools in the space, the emphasis on writing vague standards instead of rallying around the One True Tool, and the complicated &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;venv&lt;/code&gt;-based ecosystem instead of a solution similar to &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt;. What has changed in the past year? Has anything improved, is everything the same, or are things worse than they were before?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;section id="the-tools"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/"&gt;The original post&lt;/a&gt; listed a bunch of packaging tools, calling &lt;em&gt;fourteen tools at least twelve too many&lt;/em&gt;. My idea with that was that most people would be happy with one tool that does everything, but the scientific-Python folks might have special requirements that would work best as a second tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of the tools named in last year’s post, all of them still seem to be maintained. Except for Flit (zero new commits in the past 30 days) and virtualenv (only automated and semi-automated version bumps), the tools have recent commits, pull requests, and issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of those tools are still in use. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://framapiaf.org/@fcodvpt/111540079686191842"&gt;Françoise Conil analysed all PyPI packages&lt;/a&gt; and checked their PEP 517 build backends: setuptools is the most popular (at 50k packages), Poetry is second at 41k, Hatchling is third at 8.1k. Other tools to cross 500 users include Flit (4.4k), PDM (1.3k), Maturin (1.3k, build backend for Rust-based packages).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some new tools, of course. Those that crossed my radar are &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/njsmith/posy"&gt;Posy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko/rye"&gt;Rye&lt;/a&gt;. Posy is a project of Nathaniel J. Smith (of trio fame), Rye is a project of Armin Ronacher (of Flask fame). The vision for both of them is to manage Python interpreters and projects, but not have a custom build backend (instead using something like hatchling). Posy is built on top of PyBI (a format for distributing binaries of Python interpreters, proposed by Smith in draft &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0711/"&gt;PEP 711&lt;/a&gt;), Rye uses Gregory Szorc’s pre-built Pythons. Rye seems to be fairly complete and usable, Posy is right now a PoC of the PyBI format, and only offers a REPL with pre-installed packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Posy and Rye are written in Rust. On the one hand, it makes sense that the part that manages Python interpreters is not written in Python, because that would require a separate Python, not managed by Posy/Rye, to run those tools. But Rye also has its own pyproject.toml parser in Rust, and many of its commands are implemented mostly or largely using Rust (sometimes also calling one-off Python scripts; although the main tasks of creating venvs, installing packages, and working with lockfiles are handed off to &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;venv&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;pip-tools&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; respectively).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Rust and Python, there’s been another project in that vein that has grown a lot &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://astral.sh/blog/announcing-astral-the-company-behind-ruff"&gt;(and gathered a lot of funding)&lt;/a&gt; in the past year. That project is &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff"&gt;Ruff&lt;/a&gt;, which is a linter and code formatter. Ruff formats Python code, and is written in Rust. This means it’s 10–100× faster than existing tools written in Python (according to Ruff’s own benchmarks). Fast is good, I guess, but what does this say about Python? Is the fact that package tools (which aren’t rocket science, maybe except for fast dependency solvers, and which often need access to Python internals to do their job) and code formatters (which require a deep understanding of Python syntax, and parsing Python sources to ASTs, something easy by the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;ast&lt;/code&gt; Python module) are written in another language? Does this trend make Python a toy language (as it is also often considered &lt;em&gt;a glue language&lt;/em&gt; for NumPy and friends)? Also, why should contributing to a tool important to many Python developers require learning Rust?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="the-standards"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The standards&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last time we looked at packaging standards, we focused on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0582/"&gt;PEP 582&lt;/a&gt;. It proposed the introduction of &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;__pypackages__&lt;/code&gt;, which would be a place for third-party packages to be installed to locally, on a per-project basis, without involving virtual environments, similarly to what &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; is for node. The PEP was ultimately &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-582-python-local-packages-directory/963/430"&gt;rejected&lt;/a&gt; in March 2023. The PEP wasn’t perfect, and some of its choices were questionable or insufficient (such as not recursively searching for &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;__pypackages__&lt;/code&gt; in parent directories, or focusing on simple use-cases only). No new standards for something in that vein (with a better design) were proposed to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another contentious topic is lock files. Lock files for packaging systems are useful for reproducible dependency installations. The lock file records all installed packages (i.e. includes transitive dependencies) and their versions. Lock files often include checksums (like sha512) of the installed packages, and they often support telling apart packages installed via different groups of dependencies (runtime, buildtime, optional, development, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The classic way of achieving this goal are &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/code&gt; files. They are specific to pip, and they only contain a list of packages, versions, and possibly checksums. Those files can be generated by &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;pip freeze&lt;/code&gt;, or the third-party &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;pip-compile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; from &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;pip-tools&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;pip freeze&lt;/code&gt; is very basic, &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;pip-compile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; can’t handle different groups of dependencies other than making multiple &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;requirements.in&lt;/code&gt; files, compiling them, and hoping there are no conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pipenv, Poetry, and PDM have their own lockfile implementations, incompatible with one another. Rye piggybacks on top of &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;pip-tools&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Hatch doesn’t have anything in core; they’re waiting for a standard implementation (there are some plugins though). &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0665/"&gt;PEP 665&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-665-take-2-a-file-format-to-list-python-dependencies-for-reproducibility-of-an-application/11736/140"&gt;rejected&lt;/a&gt; in January 2022. Its author, Brett Cannon, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://snarky.ca/state-of-standardized-lock-files-for-python-august-2023/"&gt;is working on a PoC&lt;/a&gt; of something that &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; become a standard (named &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/brettcannon/mousebender"&gt;mousebender&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the danger of the working model adopted by the Python packaging world. Even for something as simple as lock files, there are at least four incompatible standards. An attempt at a specification was rejected due to “lukewarm reception”, even though there exist at least four implementations which are achieving roughly the same goals, and other ecosystems also went through this before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing important to Python are extension modules. Extension modules are written in C, and they are usually used to interact with libraries written in other languages (and also sometimes for performance). Poetry, PDM, and Hatchling don’t really support building extension modules. Setuptools does; &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/distutils_status_migration.html"&gt;SciPy and NumPy migrated from their custom numpy.distutils to Meson&lt;/a&gt;. The team behind the PyO3 Rust bindings for Python develops &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/PyO3/maturin"&gt;Maturin&lt;/a&gt;, which allows for building Rust-based extension modules — but it’s not useful if you’re working with C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There weren’t many packaging-related standards that were accepted in 2023. A standard worth mentioning is &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0668/"&gt;PEP 668&lt;/a&gt;, which allows distributors to prevent &lt;cite&gt;pip&lt;/cite&gt; from working (to avoid breaking distro-owned site packages) by adding an &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;EXTERNALLY-MANAGED&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; file. It was accepted in June 2022, but pip only implemented support for it in January 2023, and many distros already have enabled this feature in 2023. Preventing broken systems is a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some standards did make it through. Minor and small ones aside, the most prominent 2023 standard would be &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/"&gt;PEP 723&lt;/a&gt;: inline script metadata. It allows to add a comment block at the top of the file, that specifies the dependencies and the minimum Python version in a way that can be consumed by tools. Is it super useful? I don’t think so; setting up a project with pyproject.toml would easily allow things to grow. If you’re sending something via a GitHub gist, just make a repo. If you’re sending something by e-mail, just tar the folder. That approach promotes messy programming without source control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="learning-curves-and-the-deception-of-simple"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Learning curves and the deception of “simple”&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Word is simple, and a great beginner’s writing tool. You can make text bold with a single click. You can also make it blue in two clicks. But it’s easy to make an inconsistent mess. To make section headers, many users may just make the text bold and a bit bigger, without any consistency or semantics &lt;a class="brackets" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2024/01/15/python-packaging-one-year-later/#footnote-1" id="footnote-reference-1" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;1&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Making a consistent document with semantic formatting is hard in Word. Adding &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-create-multilevel-numbered-headings-in-word-2016/"&gt;section numbering&lt;/a&gt; requires you to select a heading and turn it into a list. There’s also supposedly some magic involved, that magic doesn’t work for me, and I have to tell Word to update the heading style. Even if you try doing things nicely, Word will randomly break, mess up the styles, mix up styles and inline ad-hoc formatting, and your document may look differently on different computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LaTeX is very confusing to a beginner, and has a massive learning curve. And you can certainly write &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;\textbf{hello}&lt;/code&gt; everywhere. But with some learning, you’ll be producing beautiful documents. You’ll define a &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;\code{}&lt;/code&gt; command that makes code monospace and adds a border today, but it might change the background and typeset in Comic Sans tomorrow if you so desire. You’ll use packages that can render code from external files with syntax highlighting. Heading numbering is on by default, but it can easily be disabled for a section. LaTeX can also automatically put new sections on new pages, for example. LaTeX was built for scientific publishing, so it has stellar support for maths and bibliographies, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s now talk about programming. Python is simple, and a great beginner’s programming language. You can write &lt;em&gt;hello world&lt;/em&gt; in a single line of code. The syntax is simpler, there are no confusing leftovers from C (like the index-based &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop) or machine-level code (like &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt;), no pointers in sight. You also don’t need to write classes at all; you don’t need to write a class only to put a &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;public static void main(String[] args)&lt;/code&gt; method there &lt;a class="brackets" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2024/01/15/python-packaging-one-year-later/#footnote-2" id="footnote-reference-2" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;2&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. You don’t need an IDE, you can just write code using any editor (even notepad.exe will do for the first day or so), you can save it as a .py  file and run it using &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;python whatever.py&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your code got more complicated? No worry, you can split it into multiple &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;.py&lt;/code&gt; files, use &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;import name_of_other_file_without_py&lt;/code&gt; and it will just work. Do you need more structure, grouping into folders perhaps? Well, forget about &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;python whatever.py&lt;/code&gt;, you must use &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;python &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-m&lt;/span&gt; whatever&lt;/code&gt;, and you must &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; to where your code is, or mess with &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;PYTHONPATH&lt;/code&gt;, or install your thing with &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt;. This simple yet common action (grouping things into folders) has massively increased complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standard library is not enough &lt;a class="brackets" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2024/01/15/python-packaging-one-year-later/#footnote-3" id="footnote-reference-3" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;3&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and you need a third-party dependency? You find some tutorial that tells you to &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;pip install&lt;/code&gt;, but &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt; will now tell you to use &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;apt&lt;/code&gt;. And &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;apt&lt;/code&gt; may work, but it may give you an ancient version that does not match the tutorial you’re reading. Or it may not have the package. Or the Internet will tell you not to use Python packages from &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;apt&lt;/code&gt;. So now you need to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2018/09/04/python-virtual-environments/"&gt;learn about venvs&lt;/a&gt; (which add more complexity, more things to remember; most tutorials teach activation, venvs are easy to mess up via basic operations like renaming a folder, and you may end up with a venv in git or your code in a venv). Or you need to pick one of the many one-stop-shop tools to manage things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other ecosystems, an IDE is often a necessity, even for beginners. The IDE will force you into a project system (maybe not the best or most common one by default, but it will still be a coherent project system). Java will force you to make more than one file with the “1 public class = 1 file” rule, and it will be easy to do so, you won’t even need an &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;import&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you want folders? In Java or C#, you just create a folder in the IDE, and create a class there. The new file may have a different &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;package&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;namespace&lt;/code&gt;, but the IDE will help you to add the correct &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;import&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;using&lt;/code&gt; to the codebase, and there is no risk of you using too many directories (including something like &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;src&lt;/code&gt;) or using too few (not making a top-level package for all your code) that will require correcting all imports. The disruption from adding a folder in Java or C# is minimal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project system will also handle third-party packages without you needing to think about where they’re downloaded or what a virtual environment is and how to activate it from different contexts. A few clicks and you’re done. And if you don’t like IDEs? Living in the CLI is certainly possible in many ecosystems, they have reasonable CLI tools for common management tasks, as well as building and running your project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PEP 723 solves a very niche problem: dependency management for single-file programs. Improving life for one-off things and messy code was apparently more important to the packaging community than any other improvements for big projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, you could adapt this lesson to static and dynamic typing. Dynamic typing is easier to get started with and requires less typing, but compile-type checking can prevent many bugs — bugs that require higher test coverage to catch with dynamic typing. That’s why the JS world has TypeScript, that’s why mypy/pyright/typing has gained a lot of mindshare in the Python world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="the-future"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The future…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/c/packaging/14"&gt;Python Packaging Discourse&lt;/a&gt;, there were some discussions about ways to improve things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, this &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/user-experience-with-porting-off-setup-py/37502"&gt;discussion about porting off setup.py&lt;/a&gt; was started by Gregory Szorc, who had &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://gregoryszorc.com/blog/2023/10/30/my-user-experience-porting-off-setup.py/"&gt;a long list of complaints&lt;/a&gt;, pointing out the issues with the communication from the packaging world, and documentation mess (his post is worth a read, or at least a skim, because it’s long and full of packaging failures). There’s one page which recommends setuptools, another which has four options with Hatchling as a default, and another still promoting Pipenv. We’ve seen this a year ago, nothing changed in that regard. Some people tried finding solutions, some people shared their opinions… and then the Discourse moderator decided to protect his PyPA friends from having to read user feedback and locked the thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many other threads about visions were had, like the one about &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/the-10-year-view-on-python-packaging-whats-yours/31834"&gt;10-year views&lt;/a&gt; or about &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/wanting-a-singular-packaging-tool-vision/21141"&gt;singular packaging tools&lt;/a&gt;. The strategy discussions, based on the user survey, had &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/python-packaging-strategy-discussion-part-2/23442"&gt;a second part&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/python-packaging-strategy-discussion-part-1/22420"&gt;first one&lt;/a&gt; concluded in January 2023), but it saw less posts than the first one, and discussions did not continue (and there were &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/structure-of-the-packaging-strategy-discussions/23478"&gt;discussions about how to hold the discussions&lt;/a&gt;). There are plans to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/draft-update-to-python-packaging-governance/31608"&gt;create a packaging council&lt;/a&gt; — design-by-committee at its finest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But all those discussions, even when not locked by an overzealous moderator, haven’t had any meaningful effect. The packaging ecosystem is still severely fragmented and confusing. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/"&gt;The PyPA docs and tutorials&lt;/a&gt; still contradict each other. The PyPA-affiliated tools still have less features than the unaffiliated competition (even the upstart Rye has some form of lockfiles, unlike Hatch or Flit), and going by the PEP 517 build backend usage statistics, they are more popular than the modern PyPA tools. The authors of similar yet competing tools have not joined forces to produce the One True Packaging Tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="is-looking-pretty-bleak"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;…is looking pretty bleak&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if you look at the 2023 contribution graphs for most packaging tools, you might be worried about the state of the packaging ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pypa/pipenv/graphs/contributors?from=2023-01-01&amp;amp;to=2023-12-31&amp;amp;type=c"&gt;Pipenv&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/graphs/contributors?from=2023-01-01&amp;amp;to=2023-12-31&amp;amp;type=c"&gt;setuptools&lt;/a&gt; have two lead committers, but still a healthy amount of commits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pypa/hatch/graphs/contributors?from=2023-01-01&amp;amp;to=2023-12-31&amp;amp;type=c"&gt;Hatch&lt;/a&gt;, however, is a &lt;strong&gt;one-man-show&lt;/strong&gt;: Ofek Lev (the project founder) made 184 commits, the second place belongs to Dependabot with 6 commits, and the third-place contributor (who is a human) has five commits.  The bus factor of Hatch and Hatchling is 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The non-PyPA tools aren’t doing much better:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I understand the PyPA is a loose association of volunteers. It is sometimes said the name &lt;em&gt;Python Packaging Authority&lt;/em&gt; was &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/remove-the-authority-from-packaging/1993"&gt;originally a joke&lt;/a&gt;. However, they are also the group that maintains all the packaging standards, so they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; the authority when it comes to packaging. For example, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0668/"&gt;PEP 668&lt;/a&gt; starts with a warning block saying it’s a historical document, and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/externally-managed-environments/"&gt;the up-to-date version of the specification is on PyPA’s site&lt;/a&gt; (as well as a bunch of other &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/"&gt;packaging specs&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The PyPA should shut down or merge some duplicate projects, and work with the community (including maintainers of non-PyPA projects) to build One True Packaging Tool.&lt;/strong&gt; To make things easier. To avoid writing code that does largely the same thing 5 times. To make sure thousands of projects don’t depend on tools with a bus factor of 1 or 2. To turn packaging from a problem and an insurmountable obstacle to something that &lt;em&gt;just works™&lt;/em&gt;, something that an average developer doesn’t need to think about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not rocket science. Tons of languages, big and small, have a coherent packaging ecosystem (just read &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/"&gt;last year’s post&lt;/a&gt; for some examples of how simple it can be). Instead of focusing on specifications and governance, focus on producing one comprehensive, usable, user-friendly tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern Word at least makes this easier, because the heading styles get top billing on the ribbon; they were hidden behind a completely non-obvious combo box that said &lt;em&gt;Normal&lt;/em&gt; in Word 2003 and older.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C# 10 removed the requirement to make a class with a &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;Main&lt;/code&gt; method, it can pick up one file with top-level statements and make it the entrypoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Python standard library gets a lot of praise. It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; large compared to C, but nothing special compared to Java or C#. It is also full of low-quality libraries, like &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;http.server&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;urllib.request&lt;/code&gt;, yet some people insist on only using the standard library. The standard library is also less stable and dependable (with constant deprecations and removals, and with new features requiring upgrading all of Python). All the “serious” use-cases, like web development or ML/AI/data science are impossible with just the standard library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

This is an area that has seen many different solutions pop up over the years, with many different opinions, wars, and attempts to solve it. Many have complained about the packaging ecosystem and tools making their lives harder. Many beginners are confused about virtual environments. But does it have to be this way? Are the current solutions to packaging problems any good? And is the organization behind most of the packaging tools and standards part of the problem itself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join me on a journey through packaging in Python and elsewhere. We’ll start by describing the classic packaging stack (involving setuptools and friends), the scientific stack (with conda), and some of the modern/alternate tools, such as Pipenv, Poetry, Hatch, or PDM. We’ll also look at some examples of packaging and dependency-related workflows seen elsewhere (Node.js and .NET). We’ll also take a glimpse at a possible future (with a venv-less workflow with PDM), and see if the PyPA agrees with the vision and insights of eight thousand users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;section id="the-plethora-of-tools"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#toc-entry-1" role="doc-backlink"&gt;The plethora of tools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many packaging-related tools in Python. All of them with different authors, lineages, and often different opinions, although most of them are now unified under the Python Packaging Authority (PyPA) umbrella. Let’s take a look at them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="the-classic-stack"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#toc-entry-2" role="doc-backlink"&gt;The classic stack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The classic Python packaging stack consists of many semi-related tools. Setuptools, probably the oldest tool of the group, and itself based on &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;distutils&lt;/code&gt;, which is part of the standard library (although it will be removed in Python 3.12), is responsible for installing a single package. It previously used &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;setup.py&lt;/code&gt; files to do its job, which required arbitrary code execution. It then added support for non-executable metadata specification formats: &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;setup.cfg&lt;/code&gt;, and also &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;pyproject.toml&lt;/code&gt; (partially still in beta). However, you aren’t supposed to use &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;setup.py&lt;/code&gt; files directly these days, you’re supposed to be using pip. Pip installs packages, usually from the PyPI, but it can also support other sources (such as git repositories or the local filesystem). But where does pip install things? The default used to be to install globally and system-wide, which meant you could introduce conflicts between packages installed by pip and apt (or whatever the system package manager is). Even with a user-wide install (which pip is likely to attempt these days), you can still end up with conflicts, and you can also have conflicts in which package A requests X version 1.0.0, but package B expects X version 2.0.0—but A and B are not at all related and could live separately with their preferred version of X. Enter &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;venv&lt;/code&gt;, a standard library descendant of &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;virtualenv&lt;/code&gt;, which can create a lightweight virtual environment for packages to live in. This virtual environment gives you the separation from system packages and from different environments, but it is still tied to the system Python in some ways (and if the system Python disappears, the virtual environment stops working).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few extra tools would be used in a typical packaging workflow. The &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;wheel&lt;/code&gt; package enhances Setuptools with the ability to generate wheels, which are ready-to-install (without running &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;setup.py&lt;/code&gt;). Wheels can either be pure-Python and be installed anywhere, or they can contain pre-compiled extension modules (things written in C) for a given OS and Python (and there’s even a standard that allows building and distributing one wheel for all typical Linux distros). The &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;wheel&lt;/code&gt; package should be an implementation detail, something existing inside Setuptools and/or pip, but users need to be aware of it if they want to make wheels on their system, because virtual environments produced by &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;venv&lt;/code&gt; do not have &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;wheel&lt;/code&gt; installed. Regular users who do not maintain their own packages may sometimes be told that pip is using something legacy because &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;wheel&lt;/code&gt; is not installed, which is not a good user experience. Package authors also need &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;twine&lt;/code&gt;, whose sole task is uploading source distributions or wheels, created with other tools, to PyPI (and there’s not much more to say about that tool).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="and-a-few-extensions"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#toc-entry-3" role="doc-backlink"&gt;…and a few extensions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, there have been a few tools that are based on things from the classic stack. For example, &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;pip-tools&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; can simplify dependency management. While &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;pip freeze&lt;/code&gt; lets you produce a file with everything installed in your environment, there is no way to specify the dependencies you need, and get a lock file with specific versions and transitive dependencies (without installing and freezing everything), there is no easy way to skip development dependencies (e.g. IPython) when you &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;pip freeze&lt;/code&gt;, and there is no workflow to update all your dependencies with just pip. &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;pip-tools&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; adds two tools, &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;pip-compile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; which takes in &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;requirements.in&lt;/code&gt; files with the packages you care about, and produces a &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;requrirements.txt&lt;/code&gt; with pinned versions of them and all transitive dependencies; and also &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;pip-sync&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, which can install &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/code&gt; and removes things not listed in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another tool that might come in useful is &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;virtualenvwrapper&lt;/code&gt;, which can help you manage (create and activate) virtual environments in a central location. It has a few bells and whistles (such as custom hooks to do actions on every virtualenv creation), although for basic usage, you could replace it with a single-line shell function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet another tool that works alongside the classic toolset is &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;pipx&lt;/code&gt;, which creates and manages virtual environments for apps written in Python. You tell it to &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;pipx install Nikola&lt;/code&gt;, and it will create a virtual environment somewhere, install Nikola into it, and put a script for launching it in &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;~/.local/bin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. While you could do it all yourself with venv and some symlinks, pipx can take care of this, and you don’t need to remember where the virtual environment is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="the-scientific-stack-and-conda"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#toc-entry-4" role="doc-backlink"&gt;The scientific stack and conda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientific Python community have had their own tools for many years. The conda tool can manage environments and packages. It doesn’t use PyPI and wheels, but rather packages from conda channels (which are prebuilt, and expect an Anaconda-distributed Python). Back in the day, when there were no wheels, this was the easiest way to get things installed on Windows; this is not as much of a problem now with binary wheels on PyPI—but the Anaconda stack is still popular in the scientific world. Conda packages can be built with &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;conda-build&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, which is separate, but closely related to &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;conda&lt;/code&gt; itself. Conda packages are not compatible with &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt; in any way, they do not follow the packaging standards used by other tools. Is this good? No, because it makes integrating the two worlds harder, but also yes, because many problems that apply to scientific packages (and their C/C++ extension modules, and their high-performance numeric libraries, and other things) do not apply to other uses of Python, so having a separate tool lets people focusing the other uses simplify their workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="the-new-tools"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#toc-entry-5" role="doc-backlink"&gt;The new tools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, new packaging tools appeared. Now, there were lots of “new fancy tools” introduced in the past, with setuptools extending distutils, then distribute forking setuptools, then distribute being merged back…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earliest “new tool” was Pipenv. Pipenv had really terrible and misleading marketing, and it merged pip and venv, in that Pipenv would create a venv and install packages in it (from &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;Pipfile&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;Pipfile.lock&lt;/code&gt;). Pipenv can place the venv in the project folder, or hide it somewhere in the project folder (the latter is the default). However, Pipenv does not handle any packages related to packaging your code, so it’s useful only for developing non-installable applications (Django sites, for example). If you’re a library developer, you need setuptools anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second new tool was Poetry. It manages environments and dependencies in a similar way to Pipenv, but it can also build &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;.whl&lt;/code&gt; files with your code, and it can upload wheels and source distributions to PyPI. This means it has pretty much all the features the other tools have, except you need just one tool. However, Poetry is opinionated, and its opinions are sometimes incompatible with the rest of the packaging scene. Poetry uses the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;pyproject.toml&lt;/code&gt; standard, but it does not follow the standard specifying how metadata should be represented in a &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;pyproject.toml&lt;/code&gt; file (PEP 621), instead using a custom &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;[tool.poetry]&lt;/code&gt; table. This is partly because Poetry came out before PEP 621, but the PEP was accepted over 2 years ago—the biggest compatibility problem is Poetry’s node-inspired &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;~&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;^&lt;/code&gt; dependency version markers, which are not compatible with PEP 508 (the dependency specification standard). Poetry can package C extension modules, although it uses setuptools’ infrastructure for this (and requires a custom &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;build.py&lt;/code&gt; script).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another similar tool is Hatch. This tool can also manage environments (it allows multiple environments per project, but it does not allow to put them in the project directory), and it can manage packages (but without lockfile support). Hatch can also be used to package a project (with PEP 621-compliant &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;pyproject.toml&lt;/code&gt; files) and upload it to PyPI. It does not support C extension modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tool that tries to be a simpler re-imagining of Setuptools is Flit. It can build and install a package using a &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;pyproject.toml&lt;/code&gt; file. It also supports uploads to PyPI. It lacks support for C extension modules, and it expects you to manage environments on your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s one more interesting (albeit not popular or well-known) tool. This tool is PDM. It can manage venvs (but it defaults to the saner &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;.venv&lt;/code&gt; location), manage dependencies, and it uses a standards-compliant &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;pyproject.toml&lt;/code&gt;. There’s also a curious little feature called PEP 582 support, which we’ll talk about later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous sections mentioned 14 (fourteen!) distinct tools. As we’ll discover soon, that’s at least 12 too many. Let’s try to compare them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let’s define nine things that we would expect packaging tools to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manage environments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Install packages&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Package/develop apps&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Package libraries&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Package C extension modules&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Install in editable mode&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lock dependencies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Support pyproject.toml files&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upload to PyPI&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div style="font-size: 90%"&gt;&lt;table class="table table-hover"&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th class="head"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tool&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class="head"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintainer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class="head"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use-case&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class="head"&gt;&lt;p&gt;# of supported features&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class="head"&gt;&lt;p&gt;# of partially supported features&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class="head"&gt;&lt;p&gt;# of unsupported features&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;setuptools&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;PyPA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making things installable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;4&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;2 (pyproject.toml partially in beta, installing—only setuptools-based sdists)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;pip&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;PyPA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Installing packages&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 (Locking dependencies only manually)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;6&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;No&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;PDM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;No&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/details&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should pay close attention to the Maintainer column in the table. The vast majority of them are maintained by PyPA, the Python Packaging Authority. Even more curiously, the two tools that have the most “Yes” values (Poetry and PDM) are not maintained by the PyPA, but instead other people completely independent of them and not participating in the working group. So, is the working group successful, if it cannot produce one fully-featured tool? Is the group successful if it has multiple projects with overlapping responsibilities? Should the group focus their efforts on standards like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/"&gt;PEP 517&lt;/a&gt;, which is a common API for packaging tools, and which also encourages the creation of even more incompatible and competing tools?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly: which tool should a beginner use? The PyPA has a few guides and tutorials, one is &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/"&gt;using pip + venv&lt;/a&gt;, another is &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/managing-dependencies/"&gt;using pipenv&lt;/a&gt; (why would you still do that?), and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/"&gt;another tutorial&lt;/a&gt; that lets you pick between Hatchling (hatch’s build backend), setuptools, Flit, and PDM, without explaining the differences between them—and without using any environment tools, and without using Hatch’s/PDM’s build and PyPI upload features (instead opting to use &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;python &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-m&lt;/span&gt; build&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;twine&lt;/code&gt;). The concept of virtual environments can be very confusing for beginners, and managing virtual environments is difficult if everyone has incompatible opinions about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also notable that &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/"&gt;PEP 20&lt;/a&gt;, the Zen of Python, states this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python packaging definitely does not follow it &lt;a class="brackets" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#footnote-1" id="footnote-reference-1" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;1&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. There are 14 ways, and none of them is obvious or the only good one. All in all, this is an unsalvageable mess. Why can’t Python pick one tool? What does the competition do? We’ll look at this in a minute. But first, let’s talk about the elephant in the room: Python virtual environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="does-python-really-need-virtual-environments"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#toc-entry-7" role="doc-backlink"&gt;Does Python really need virtual environments?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python relies on virtual environments for separation between projects. Virtual environments (aka virtualenvs or venvs) are folders with symlinks to a system-installed Python, and their own set of site-packages. There are a few problems with them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="how-to-use-python-from-a-virtual-environment"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#toc-entry-8" role="doc-backlink"&gt;How to use Python from a virtual environment?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to do this. The first one is to activate it, by running the activate shell script installed in the environment’s bin directory. Another is to run the python executable (or any other script in the bin directory) directly from the venv. &lt;a class="brackets" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#footnote-2" id="footnote-reference-2" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;2&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Activating venvs directly is more convenient for developers, but it also has some problems. Sometimes, activation fails to work, due to the shell caching the location of things in &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;$PATH&lt;/code&gt;. Also, beginners are taught to &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;activate&lt;/code&gt; and run &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;python&lt;/code&gt;, which means they might be confused and try to use activate in scripts or cronjobs (but in those environments, you should not activate venvs, and instead use the Python executable directly). Virtual environment activation is more state you need to be aware of, and if you forget about it, or if it breaks, you might end up messing up your user-wide (or worse, system-wide) Python packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="how-are-system-pythons-and-virtual-environments-related"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#toc-entry-9" role="doc-backlink"&gt;How are (system) Pythons and virtual environments related?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The virtual environment depends very tightly on the (system/global/pyenv-installed) Python used to create it. This is good for disk-space reasons (clean virtual environments don’t take up very much space), but this also makes the environment more fragile. If the Python used to create the environment is removed, the virtual environment stops working. If you fully manage your own Python, then it’s probably not going to happen, but if you depend on a system Python, upgrading packages on your OS might end up replacing Python 3.10 with Python 3.11. Some distributions (e.g. Ubuntu) would only make a jump like this on a new distribution release (so you can plan ahead), some of them (e.g. Arch) are rolling-release and a regular system upgrade may include a new Python, whereas some (e.g. Homebrew) make it even worse by using paths that include the patch Python version (3.x.y), which cause virtual environments to break much more often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="how-to-manage-virtual-environments"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#toc-entry-10" role="doc-backlink"&gt;How to manage virtual environments?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The original virtualenv tool, and its simplified standard library rewrite venv, allow you to put a virtual environment anywhere in the file system, as long as you have write privileges there. This has led to people and tools inventing their own standards. Virtualenvwrapper stores environments in a central location, and does not care about their contents. Pipenv and poetry allow you to choose (either a central location or the .venv directory in the project), and environments are tied to a project (they will use the project-specific environment if you’re in the project directory). Hatch stores environments in a central location, and it allows you to have multiple environments per project (but there is no option to share environments between projects).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brett Cannon has recently done &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://snarky.ca/classifying-python-virtual-environment-workflows/"&gt;a survey&lt;/a&gt;, and it has shown the community is split on their workflows: some people use a central location, some put them in the project directory, some people have multiple environments with different Python versions, some people reuse virtualenvs between projects… Everyone has different needs, and different opinions. For example, I use a central directory (~/virtualenvs) and reuse environments when working on Nikola (sharing the same environment between development and 4 Nikola sites). But on the other hand, when deploying web apps, the venv lives in the project folder, because this venv needs to be used by processes running as different users (me, root, or the service account for the web server, which might have interactive login disabled, or whose home directory may be set to something ephemeral).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So: &lt;strong&gt;does Python need virtual environments?&lt;/strong&gt; Perhaps looking how other languages handle this problem can help us figure this out for Python?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll look at two ecosystems. We’ll start with &lt;a class="reference internal" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#javascript-node-js-with-npm"&gt;JavaScript/Node.js (with npm)&lt;/a&gt;, and then we’ll look at the &lt;a class="reference internal" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#c-net-with-dotnet-cli-msbuild"&gt;C#/.NET (with dotnet CLI/MSBuild)&lt;/a&gt; ecosystem for comparison. We’ll demonstrate a sample flow of making a project, installing dependencies in it, and running things. If you’re familiar with those ecosystems and want to skip the examples, continue with &lt;a class="reference internal" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#how-is-node-better-than-python"&gt;How is Node better than Python?&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class="reference internal" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#are-those-ecosystems-tools-perfect"&gt;Are those ecosystems’ tools perfect?&lt;/a&gt;. Otherwise, read on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two tools for dealing with packages in the Node world, namely npm and Yarn. The npm CLI tool is shipped with Node, so we’ll focus on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s create a project:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mere existence of an &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;is-even&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; package is questionable; the fact that it includes four dependencies is yet another, and the fact that it depends on &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;is-odd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is even worse. But this post isn’t about &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;is-even&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; or the Node ecosystem’s tendency to use tiny packages for everything (but I wrote one about this topic &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2019/02/15/modern-web-development-where-you-need-500-packages-to-build-bootstrap/"&gt;before&lt;/a&gt;).

&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt; file now lists the dependency, and we’ve also got a lock file (&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;package-lock.json&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;), which records all the dependency versions used for this install. If this file is kept in the repository, any future attempts to &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt; will use the dependency versions listed in this file, ensuring everything will work the same as it did originally (unless one of those packages were to get removed from the registry).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Badly designed packages aside, we can see an important difference from Python in that there is &lt;strong&gt;no virtual environment&lt;/strong&gt;, and all the packages live in the project directory. If we fix the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; directory by running &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt;, we can see that I can run the script from somewhere else on the file system:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re using a manually managed venv, you need to remember to activate it, or to use the appropriate Python.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re using something fancier, it might be tied to the current working directory, and it may expect you to change into that directory, or to pass an argument pointing at that directory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can also run my code as &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;root&lt;/code&gt;, and as an unprivileged &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;nginx&lt;/code&gt; user, without any special preparation (like telling pipenv/poetry to put their venv in the project directory, or running them as the other users):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you try to do that with a Python tool…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re using a manually managed venv, you can use its Python as another user (assuming it has the right permissions).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your tool puts the venv in the project directory, this will work too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your tool puts the venv in some weird place in your home folder, the other users will get their own venvs. The &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;uwsgi&lt;/code&gt; user on Fedora uses &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;/run/uwsgi&lt;/code&gt; as its home directory, and &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;/run&lt;/code&gt; is ephemeral (tmpfs), so a reboot forces you to reinstall things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can even try to change the name of our project:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you try to do that with a Python tool…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re using a manually managed venv, and it lives in a central directory, all is well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you or your tool places the venv in the project directory, the venv is now broken, and you need to recreate it (hope you have a recent &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;requirements.txt&lt;/code&gt;!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your tool puts the venv in some weird place in your home folder, it may decide that this is a different project, which means it will recreate it, and you’ll have an unused virtual environment somewhere on your filesystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some packages may expose executable scripts (with the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;bin&lt;/code&gt; property). Those can be run in three ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Installed globally using &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;npm install &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, which would put the script in a global location that’s likely in &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;$PATH&lt;/code&gt; (e.g. &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;/usr/local/bin&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Installed locally using &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt;, and executed with the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;npx&lt;/code&gt; tool or manually by running the script in &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;node_packages/.bin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not installed at all, but executed using the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;npx&lt;/code&gt; tool, which will install it into a cache and run it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, if we wanted to publish our thing, we can just run &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;npm publish&lt;/code&gt; (after logging in with &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;npm login&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In modern .NET, the One True Tool is the dotnet CLI, which uses MSBuild for most of the heavy lifting. (In the classic .NET Framework, the duties were split between MSBuild and NuGet.exe, but let’s focus on the modern workflow.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get three things: a &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;mydotnetproject.csproj&lt;/code&gt; file, which defines a few properties of our project; &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;Program.cs&lt;/code&gt;, which is a hello world program, and &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;obj/&lt;/code&gt;, which contains a few files you don’t need to care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s try adding a dependency. For a pointless example, but slightly more reasonable than the JS one, we’ll use &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;AutoFixture&lt;/code&gt;, which brings in a dependency on &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;Fare&lt;/code&gt;. If we run &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;dotnet add package AutoFixture&lt;/code&gt;, we get some console output, and our &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;mydotnetproject.csproj&lt;/code&gt; now looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;lt;PropertyGroup&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; specifies what our project is (Exe = something you can run), specifies the target framework (.NET 6.0 &lt;a class="brackets" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#footnote-3" id="footnote-reference-3" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;3&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), and enables a few opt-in features of C#.

&lt;p&gt;If we want something that can be run outside of the project, and possibly without .NET installed on the system, we can use dotnet publish. The most basic scenario:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code text"&gt;&lt;a id="rest_code_b7fdf433765b4e49afca3ad4a26926df-1" name="rest_code_b7fdf433765b4e49afca3ad4a26926df-1" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#rest_code_b7fdf433765b4e49afca3ad4a26926df-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;$ dotnet publish

&lt;p&gt;You can see that we’ve got a few files related to our project, as well as &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;AutoFixture.dll&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;Fare.dll&lt;/code&gt;, which are our dependencies (&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;Fare.dll&lt;/code&gt; is a dependency of &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;AutoFixture.dll&lt;/code&gt;).

&lt;p&gt;We have a single output file that contains our program, its dependencies, and parts of the .NET runtime. We also get debugging symbols if we want to run our binary with a .NET debugger and see the associated source code. (There are ways to make the binary file smaller, and we can move most arguments of &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;dotnet publish&lt;/code&gt; to the .csproj file, but this post is about Python, not .NET, so I’m not going to focus on them too much.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="how-is-net-better-than-python"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#toc-entry-16" role="doc-backlink"&gt;How is .NET better than Python?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to bore you with the same demonstrations I’ve already shown when discussing &lt;a class="reference internal" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#how-is-node-better-than-python"&gt;How is Node better than Python?&lt;/a&gt;, but:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can run built .NET projects as any user, from anywhere in the filesystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All you need to run your code is the output directory (publishing is optional, but useful to have a cleaner output, to simplify deployment, and to possibly enable compilation to native code).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you do publish in single-executable mode, you can just distribute the single executable, and your users don’t even need to have .NET installed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You do not need to manage environments, you do not need special tools to run your code, you do not need to think about the current working directory when running code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="other-packaging-topics-1"&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#toc-entry-17" role="doc-backlink"&gt;Other packaging topics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locking dependencies is disabled by default, but if you add &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;&amp;lt;RestorePackagesWithLockFile&amp;gt;true&amp;lt;/RestorePackagesWithLockFile&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;lt;PropertyGroup&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in your &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;.csproj&lt;/code&gt; file, you can enable it (and get a &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;packages.lock.json&lt;/code&gt; file in output).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/global-tools"&gt;command line tools&lt;/a&gt;, .NET has support for those as well. They can be installed globally or locally, and may be accessed via $PATH or via the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;dotnet&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for publishing your package to NuGet.org or to another repository, you might want to look at the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/quickstart/create-and-publish-a-package-using-the-dotnet-cli"&gt;full docs&lt;/a&gt; for more details, but the short version is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add some metadata to the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;.csproj&lt;/code&gt; file (e.g. &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;PackageId&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;Version&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;dotnet pack&lt;/code&gt; to get a &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;.nupkg&lt;/code&gt; file&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;dotnet nuget push&lt;/code&gt; to upload the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;.nupkg&lt;/code&gt; file (passing the file name and an API key)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, everything is done with a single &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;dotnet&lt;/code&gt; tool. The .NET IDEs (in particular, Visual Studio and Rider) do offer friendly GUI versions of many features. Some of those GUIs might be doings things slightly differently behind the scenes, but this is transparent to the user (and the backend is still MSBuild or a close derivative of it). I can take a CLI-created project, add a dependency from Rider, and publish an executable from VS, and everything will work the same. And perhaps XML files aren’t as cool as TOML, but they’re still easy to work with in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="other-languages-and-ecosystems"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#toc-entry-18" role="doc-backlink"&gt;Other languages and ecosystems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we have explored two tools for two languages in depth, there are also other languages that deserve at least a mention. In the &lt;strong&gt;Java&lt;/strong&gt; world, the two most commonly used tools are Maven and Gradle. Both tools can be used to manage dependencies and build artifacts that can be executed or distributed further (things like JAR files). Other tools with support for building Java projects exist, but most people just pick one of the two. The community of &lt;strong&gt;Scala&lt;/strong&gt;, which is another JVM-based language, prefers sbt (which can be used for plain Java as well), but there are also Maven or Gradle users in that community. Finally, two new-ish languages which are quite popular in the recent times, &lt;strong&gt;Go&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Rust&lt;/strong&gt;, have first-party tooling integrated with the rest of the toolchain. The &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;go&lt;/code&gt; command-line tool can accomplish many build/dependency/packaging tasks. Rust’s &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;cargo&lt;/code&gt;, which ships with the standard distribution of Rust, handles dependencies, builds, running code and tests, as well as publishing your stuff to a registry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="are-those-ecosystems-tools-perfect"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#toc-entry-19" role="doc-backlink"&gt;Are those ecosystems’ tools perfect?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not always, they have their deficiencies as well. In the Node ecosystem, packages may execute arbitrary code on install, which can be a security risk (there are some known examples, like a npm package &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/03/sabotage-code-added-to-popular-npm-package-wiped-files-in-russia-and-belarus/"&gt;wiping hard drives in Russia and Belarus&lt;/a&gt;, or another one &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/11/hacker-backdoors-widely-used-open-source-software-to-steal-bitcoin/"&gt;stealing &lt;s&gt;imaginary Internet money&lt;/s&gt; Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;). Binary packages are not distributed on the npm registry directly, they’re either built with &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;node-gyp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, or have prebuilt packages downloaded via &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;node-pre-gyp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (which is a third-party tool).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the .NET ecosystem, the tools also create an &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;obj&lt;/code&gt; directory with temporary files. Those temporary files are tied to the environment they’re running in, and while the tooling will usually re-create them if something changes, it can sometimes fail and leave you with confusing errors (which can generally be solved by removing the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;bin&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;obj&lt;/code&gt; directories). If a package depends on native code (which is not already available on the target OS as part of a shared library), it must include binary builds in the NuGet package for all the platforms it supports, as there is &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/NuGet/Home/issues/9631"&gt;no standard way&lt;/a&gt; to allow building something from source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also find deficiencies in the tools for the other languages mentioned. Some people think Maven is terrible because it uses XML and Gradle is the way to go, and others think Gradle’s use of a Groovy-based DSL makes things much harder than they need to be and prefer Maven instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="pep-582-the-future-of-python-packaging"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#toc-entry-20" role="doc-backlink"&gt;PEP 582: the future of Python packaging?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall that when introducing PDM, I mentioned &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0582/"&gt;PEP 582&lt;/a&gt;. This PEP defines a &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;__pypackages__&lt;/code&gt; directory. This directory would be taken into consideration by Python when looking for imports. It would behave similarly to &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt;. Since there will be no symlinks to the system Python, it will resolve the issues with moving the virtual environment. Because the packages live in the project, there is no problem with sharing a project directory between multiple system users. It might even be possible for different computers (but with the same Python version and OS) to share the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;__pypackages__&lt;/code&gt; directory (in some specific cases). The proposed &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;__pypackages__&lt;/code&gt; directory structure has &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;lib/python3.10/site-packages/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; subfolders, which still makes the “reinstall on Python upgrade” step mandatory, but it doesn’t apply to minor version upgrades, and if you’re dealing with a pure-Python dependency tree, &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;mv __pypackages__/lib/python3.10 __pypackages__/lib/python3.11&lt;/code&gt; might just work. This structure does make sense for binary dependencies, or for dependencies necessary only on older Python versions, as it allows you to use multiple Python versions with the same project directory. The PEP does not say anything about sharing &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;__pypackages__&lt;/code&gt; between projects, but you could probably solve that problem with symlinks (assuming the tooling doesn’t care if the directory is a symlink, and it shouldn’t care IMO).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While PEP 582 is a great vision, and it would simplify many package-related workflows, it hasn’t seen much care from the powers-that-be. The PEP was proposed in May 2018, and there’s even &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/kushaldas/pep582/blob/main/pep582.py"&gt;a usable implementation&lt;/a&gt; that’s less than 50 lines of code, there &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-582-python-local-packages-directory/963/"&gt;hasn’t been much progress&lt;/a&gt; on having it accepted and implemented in Python proper. However, PDM does not care, and it allows you to enable the future on your own machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="enabling-the-future-on-your-own-machine"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#toc-entry-21" role="doc-backlink"&gt;Enabling the future on your own machine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s enable the future on my own machine. That will require one simple command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code text"&gt;&lt;a id="rest_code_82709f5dd12448fc8a5b5e87c385e5a1-1" name="rest_code_82709f5dd12448fc8a5b5e87c385e5a1-1" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#rest_code_82709f5dd12448fc8a5b5e87c385e5a1-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;$ eval "$(pdm --pep582)"
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that, we can initialize our project and install requests into it. Let’s try:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, almost. There are two things that I have complaints about. The first one is the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;pdm &lt;span class="pre"&gt;--pep582&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; hack, but hopefully, the PyPA gets its act together and gets it into Python core soon. However, another important problem is the lack of separation from system site-packages. Avid readers of footnotes &lt;a class="brackets" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#footnote-6" id="footnote-reference-6" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;6&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; might have noticed I had to use a Docker container in my PDM experiments, because requests is very commonly found in system &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;site-packages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (especially when using system Pythons, which have requests because of some random package, or because it was unbundled from pip). &lt;a class="brackets" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#footnote-7" id="footnote-reference-7" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;7&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; This can break things in ways you don’t expect, because you might end up importing and depending on system-wide things, or mixing system-wide and local packages (if you don’t install an extra requirement, but those packages are present system-wide, then you might end up using an extra you haven’t asked for). This is an important problem—a good solution would be to disable system site-packages if a &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;__pypackages__&lt;/code&gt; directory is in use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="the-part-where-the-steering-council-kills-it"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#toc-entry-23" role="doc-backlink"&gt;The part where the Steering Council kills it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late March 2023, the Python Steering Council has announced &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-582-python-local-packages-directory/963/430"&gt;the rejection of PEP 582&lt;/a&gt;. The reasons cited in the SC decision cited the limitations of the PEP (the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;__pypackages__&lt;/code&gt; directory not always being enough, and the lack of specification on how it would behave in edge cases). Another argument is that it is possible to get &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;__pypackages__&lt;/code&gt; via “one of the many existing customization mechanisms for &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;sys.path&lt;/code&gt;, like &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;.pth&lt;/code&gt; files or a &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;sitecustomize&lt;/code&gt; module” — things commonly considered hacks, not real solutions. While users certainly can do anything they want to the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;sys.path&lt;/code&gt; (often with tragic consequences), the point of having a common standard is to encourage tools to add support for it — if you use the aforementioned hacks, your IDE might end up not noticing the packages or considering them part of your code (trying to index them and search for things in them). Another reason cited for the rejection is the disagreement among the packaging community, which should not be surprising, especially in light of the next section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PEP 582/&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;__pypackages__&lt;/code&gt; mechanism may become official one day, and finally make Python packaging approachable. That would probably require someone to step up and write a new PEP that would make more people happy. Or Python might be stuck with all these incompatible tools, and invent 10 more in the next few years. (PDM is still there, and it still supports &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;__pypackages__&lt;/code&gt;, even though its implementation isn’t exactly the same as suggested by the now-rejected PEP.) Python’s current trajectory, as demonstrated by this decision, and by many people still being forced to struggle with the needlessly complicated virtual environments, sounds an awful lot like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%27No_Way_to_Prevent_This,%27_Says_Only_Nation_Where_This_Regularly_Happens"&gt;the classic Onion headline&lt;/a&gt;: ‘No Way to Prevent This,’ Says Only Programming Community Where This Regularly Happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;section id="pypa-versus-reality-packaging-survey-results-and-pypa-reaction"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#toc-entry-24" role="doc-backlink"&gt;PyPA versus reality: packaging survey results and PyPA reaction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some time ago, the PSF ran a survey on packaging. Over 8000 people responded. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U5d5SiXLVkzDpS0i1dJIA4Hu5Qg704T9/view"&gt;The users have spoken:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people think packaging is too complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An overwhelming majority prefers using just a single tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people also think the existence of multiple tools is not beneficial for the Python packaging ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Virtually everyone would prefer a clearly defined official workflow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over 50% of responses think tools for other ecosystems are better at managing dependencies and installing packages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step after this survey was for the packaging community to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/python-packaging-strategy-discussion-part-1/22420"&gt;discuss its results&lt;/a&gt; and try to come up with a new packaging strategy. The first post from Shamika Mohanan (the Packaging Project Manager at PSF) that triggered the discussion also focused heavily on the users’ vision to unify packaging tools and to have One True Tool. This discussion was open to people involved with the packaging world; many participants of the discussion are involved with PyPA, and I don’t think I’ve seen a single comment from the people behind Poetry or PDM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the thread ended up being discussion of binary extensions, including discussions of how to help tool proliferation by making it possible for tools that aren’t setuptools to build binary extensions. There was also a lot of focus on the scientific community’s issues with &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pypackaging-native.github.io/"&gt;libraries with native code&lt;/a&gt;, heavily rooted in C/C++, and with attempts to replace Conda with new PyPA-approved tools. The “unified tool” for everyone else was mentioned in some posts, but they were certainly the minority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some PyPA members talked about a UX analysis, and that they expect the unified tool to be re-exporting functionality from existing tools—which immediately raises the question: which tools should it export functionality from and why? Is &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;pip install &lt;span class="pre"&gt;unified-packaging-tool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; going to bring in all fourteen? Is the fact that users are unhappy with what they have, and many of them would be happy with something lke npm/dotnet/cargo, not enough to determine the UX direction of the unified tool?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of them are also against breaking existing workflows. Is a unified packaging tool going to work for every single user? Definitely not. But are there that many distinct basic workflows? If we ignore things that border on bikeshedding, such as src vs no-src, or venv locations, are there that many workflows to consider? Someone making a library and someone making an application do have different needs (e.g. with regard to publishing the package or acceptable dependency versions). Someone working with C extensions (or extensions using something like Cython) may have different needs, but their needs would usually be a superset of the needs of someone working on a pure-Python project. The scientific community might have more specialized needs, related to complex non-Python parts, but I am positive many of their points could be solved by the unified tool as well, even if it’s not by the time this tool reaches v1.0. It is also possible that the scientific community might prefer to stay with Conda, or with some evolution of it that brings it closer in line with the Unified Packaging Tool but also solves the scientists’ needs better than a tool also solving the non-scientists’ needs can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there’s a discussion about the existing tools and which one is the tool for the future. The maintainer of Hatch (Ofek Lev) says that &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/python-packaging-strategy-discussion-part-1/22420/4"&gt;Hatch can provide the “unified UX”&lt;/a&gt;. But do the maintainers of Poetry or PDM agree? Poetry seems to be far more active than Hatch, going by GitHub issues, and it’s also worth noting that Hatch’s bus factor is 1 (with Ofek Lev responsible for 542 out of 576 commits to the master branch). &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/python-packaging-strategy-discussion-part-1/22420/46"&gt;Russell Keith-Magee from BeeWare&lt;/a&gt; has highlighted the fact that tooling aside, the PyPA does a bad job at communicating things. Russell mentioned that one of PyPA tutorials now uses Hatch, but there is no way to know if the PyPA considers Hatch to be the future, are people supposed to migrate onto Hatch, and is Flit, another recent PyPA tool, now useless? Russell also makes good points about focusing efforts: should people focus on helping Hatch support extension modules (which, according to the Hatch maintainer, is the last scenario requiring setuptools; other participants note that you can already build native code without setuptools), or should people focus on improving setuptools compatibility with PEP 517?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were also some people stating their opinions on unifying things in various ways—and many of them are &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/python-packaging-strategy-discussion-part-1/22420/136"&gt;against&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/python-packaging-strategy-discussion-part-1/22420/137"&gt;unifying&lt;/a&gt; things. There were some voices of reason, like that of Russell Keith-Magee, or of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/python-packaging-strategy-discussion-part-1/22420/140"&gt;Simon Notley&lt;/a&gt;, who correctly noticed the thread fails to resolve problems of developers, who are confused about packaging, and don’t understand the different choices available and how they interoperate. Simon does agree that native dependencies are important and happen often in Python projects (and so do I), but the users who responded to the survey had something else in mind — as exemplified by the discussion opening post, mentioning the user expecting the simplicity of Rust’s cargo, and by the survey results. 70% of the survey respondents also use &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;npm&lt;/code&gt;, so many Python users have already seen the simpler workflows. The survey respondents were also asked to rank a few focus areas based on importance. “Making Python packaging better serve common use cases and workflows” was ranked first out of the provided options &lt;a class="brackets" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#footnote-8" id="footnote-reference-8" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;8&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by 3248 participants. “Supporting a wider range of use cases (e.g. edge cases, etc.)” was ranked first by 379 people, and it was the least important in the minds of 2989 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more point that highlights the detachment of packaging folk from reality was mentioned by Anderson Bravalheri. To Anderson, a new unified tool would be &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://discuss.python.org/t/python-packaging-strategy-discussion-part-1/22420/133"&gt;disrespectful of the work&lt;/a&gt; the maintainers of the existing tools put into maintaining them, and disrespectful of users who had to adapt to the packaging mess. This point is completely absurd. Was the replacement of MS-DOS/Windows 9x and Classic Mac OS with Windows NT and &lt;s&gt;Mac OS X&lt;/s&gt; &lt;s&gt;OS X&lt;/s&gt; macOS disrespectful to their respective designers, and the users who had to adapt to manually configuring minutiae, figuring out how to get all your software and hardware to run with weird limitations that were necessary in the 1980s, and the system crashing every once in a while? Was the replacement of horses with cars disrespectful to horses, and the people who were removing horse manure from the streets? Was the replacement of the Ford Model T with faster, safer, more efficient, and easier to use cars disrespectful to Henry Ford? Technology comes and goes, and sometimes, getting an improvement means we need to get rid of the old stuff. This applies outside of technology, too—you could come up with many examples of change in the world, which might have put some people out of power, but has greatly improved the lives of millions of people (the fall of communism in Europe, for example). Also, going back to the technology world of today, this sentiment suggests Anderson is far too attached to the software they write—is this a healthy approach?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody raised PEP 582 or the complexity of virtual environments. It might not be visible from the ivory towers of packaging tool maintainers, who have years of experience dealing with them, but it certainly does exist for regular people, for people who think the Python provided by their Linux distro is good enough, and especially for people for whom Python is their introduction to programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to once again highlight: that’s not just the opinion of one random rambling Chris. The opinion that Python packaging needs to be simplified and unified is held by about half of the 8774 people who took the survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here’s one more interesting thing: Discourse, the platform that the discussion was held on, shows the number of times a link was clicked. Granted, this count might not be always accurate, but if we assume it is, the link to the results summary was clicked only 14 times (as of 2023-01-14 21:20 UTC). The discussion has 28 participants and 2.2k views. If we believe the link click counter, &lt;strong&gt;half of the discussion participants did not even bother reading what the people think&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Python packaging is a mess, and it always has been. There are tons of tools, mostly incompatible with each other, and no tool can solve &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; problems (especially no tool from the PyPA). PDM is really close to the ideal, since it can do away with the overhead of managing virtual environments—which is hopefully the future of Python packaging, or the 2010s of Node.js packaging (although it is not going to be the 2023 of Python packaging, considering the Steering Council rejection). Perhaps in a few years, Python developers (and more importantly, Python learners!) will be able to just &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;pip install&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;pdm install&lt;/code&gt;?) what they need, without worrying about some “virtual environment” thing, that is separate but not quite from a system Python, and that is not a virtual machine. Python needs less tools, not more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carthago_delenda_est"&gt;Furthermore, I consider that the PyPA must be destroyed.&lt;/a&gt; The strategy discussion highlights the fact that they are unable to make Python packaging work the way the users expect. The PyPA should focus on producing one good tool, and on getting PEP 582 into Python. A good way to achieve this would be to put its resources behind PDM. The issues with native code and binary wheels are important, but plain-Python workflows, or workflows with straightforward binary dependencies, are much more common, and need to be improved. This improvement needs to happen now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funnily enough, the aphorism itself fails at “one obvious way to do it”. It is with dashes set in two different ways (with spaces after but not before, and with spaces before but not after), and none of them is the correct one (most English style guides prefer no spaces, but some allow spaces on both sides).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apologies for the slight Linux focus of this post; all the points I make apply on Windows as well, but perhaps with some slightly different names and commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;aside class="footnote brackets" id="footnote-3" role="doc-footnote"&gt;
&lt;span class="label"&gt;&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a role="doc-backlink" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#footnote-reference-3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a new major version of .NET every year, with the even-numbered versions being LTS. Those are far less revolutionary than the Python 2 → 3 transition, and after you jump on the modern .NET train, upgrading a project to the new major version is fairly simple (possibly even just bumping the version number).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;aside class="footnote brackets" id="footnote-4" role="doc-footnote"&gt;
&lt;span class="label"&gt;&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a role="doc-backlink" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#footnote-reference-4"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to be extra sure, I used a clean &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;python:latest&lt;/code&gt; Docker container, since requests is so commonly found in system site packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;aside class="footnote brackets" id="footnote-5" role="doc-footnote"&gt;
&lt;span class="label"&gt;&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a role="doc-backlink" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#footnote-reference-5"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little caveat here, I also had to remove the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;dist-info&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; folder, so that PDM would know it needs to be reinstalled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;aside class="footnote brackets" id="footnote-6" role="doc-footnote"&gt;
&lt;span class="label"&gt;&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a role="doc-backlink" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2023/01/15/how-to-improve-python-packaging/#footnote-reference-6"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, that’s you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, why is there no good HTTP client library in Python’s standard library? Is the “standard library is where packages go to die” argument still relevant, if requests had four releases in 2022, and urllib3 had six, and most of the changes were minor?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;aside class="footnote brackets" id="footnote-8" role="doc-footnote"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have removed the “Other” option, and shifted all options ranked below it by one place, since we don’t know what the other thing was and how it related to the options presented (the free-form responses were removed from the public results spreadsheet to preserve the users’ anonymity). In the event a respondent left some of the options without a number, the blank options were not considered neither first nor last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post got amended in April 2023 with an update about the SC rejection of PEP 582 (in a new subsection and in the Summary section).&lt;/p&gt;

This post tells you more about the language, the .NET ecosystem, and why you should write your next app in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;section id="what-is-the-app"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is the app?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app is called Gitco.NET. It’s basically a rewrite of a previous Ruby script. It shows a console menu with Git branches, allowing things like filtering and toggling the display of remote branches. Simple, but quite convenient for working with Git in a terminal. I rewrote it in C# for better Windows compatibility — but the new version works on Linux and macOS equally well, can be distributed as a single executable, and is also unit-tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="what-is-c"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is C#?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C# is a modern, high-level language designed by Microsoft in 2000, heavily inspired by (and competing with) Java.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="the-obligatory-hello-world-program"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The obligatory hello world program&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code csharp"&gt;&lt;a id="rest_code_6269256e74634d7fb0787d382a281646-1" name="rest_code_6269256e74634d7fb0787d382a281646-1" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2022/09/19/writing-a-console-app-in-c-sharp-for-fun-and-profit/#rest_code_6269256e74634d7fb0787d382a281646-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;WriteLine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;"Hello, world!"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just one line is enough. This program requires C# 10 and .NET 6, the latest versions of the language and the framework (and the implicit usings feature enabled).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

We can see the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;using&lt;/code&gt; directive to import everything from the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;System&lt;/code&gt; namespace, the definition of a &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;class&lt;/code&gt;, a &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;Main&lt;/code&gt; method, and a call to &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;Console.WriteLine&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll talk more about C# later, highlighting some of the cooler things seen in Gitco.NET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="what-is-net"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is .NET?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The term “.NET” had quite a lot of meanings over the past two decades. Microsoft accounts were once called .NET Passport, and Windows Server 2003 was almost called “Windows Server .NET 2003”. Another thing called .NET was the .NET Framework. .NET Framework is a heavily integrated component of Windows, and it’s basically what was used to run C# (and F#, and VB.NET) — it includes the virtual machine (CLR, Core Language Runtime), a lot of libraries (Framework Class Library), and a lot of Windows-specific things (such as COM, Windows Forms, WPF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s .NET Framework is proprietary and tied to Windows. An open-source, independent re-implementation of .NET is Mono. At one point, some GNOME apps were written in Mono and Gtk#. Mono was also used in Xamarin, which can be used to write Android and iOS apps in C#.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then came out .NET Core, which is Microsoft’s open-source .NET with a new runtime (CoreCLR), new set of libraries (CoreFX), and multi-platform compatibility (Linux and macOS). After a few years, .NET Core got renamed to .NET (around the time it had pretty good feature parity with the classic .NET Framework). With the new .NET, you can build console apps, web apps (using ASP.NET Core, which is a pretty cool framework), mobile apps (soon using MAUI), and desktop apps (there are a few options).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This snippet defines a fairly standard pipeline that goes from &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; output (a single string) to a list of parsed objects. This pipeline is a function (or a static method, to be more precise). This function uses expression-bodied members: since we can fit the entire pipeline in a single expression, we can skip the braces and the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; keyword, and instead use a more compact syntax with an arrow (&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;). After some cleanups and sanitization of the string, we split the string by the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt; character, and the type of our pipeline changes from &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;string[]&lt;/code&gt; (an array of strings). We then use five operations from the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;System.Linq&lt;/code&gt; namespace. Those operations are extension methods for enumerables (&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;IEnumerable&amp;lt;T&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;) — adding &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;using System.Linq;&lt;/code&gt; at the top of your program adds those methods to any enumerables (including arrays, lists, dictionaries, sets…).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first operation is a &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;Select&lt;/code&gt;. LINQ methods are inspired by SQL; the more typical name for this one would be &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;. (Similarly, &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;Where&lt;/code&gt; is LINQ’s name for &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt;.) The logic inside &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;Select&lt;/code&gt; is written in a multi-line anonymous function (lambda), with braces (so there’s a &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;) &lt;a class="brackets" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2022/09/19/writing-a-console-app-in-c-sharp-for-fun-and-profit/#footnote-2" id="footnote-reference-2" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;2&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Inside that anonymous function, there are a few niceties, such as &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;var&lt;/code&gt; (type inference for variables), slicing (&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;[2..]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;), as well as some more LINQ in string manipulations (&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;.First()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;.Skip(2)&lt;/code&gt;, which do what they say on the tin).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next three operations are fairly straightforward sorting, and extracting unique values. Those use single-expression lambdas, which don’t use &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;. The pipeline ends with converting &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;IEnumerable&amp;lt;Branch&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; (which appeared at the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;.Select()&lt;/code&gt; stage) into a &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;List&amp;lt;Branch&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This function adds numbers to the branch list, and then filters branches based on the user’s query. The first thing to notice is the second argument: &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;string? filter&lt;/code&gt;. C# has support for nullable types, which means the compiler warns you if you use a possibly null value somewhere it isn’t expected &lt;a class="brackets" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2022/09/19/writing-a-console-app-in-c-sharp-for-fun-and-profit/#footnote-3" id="footnote-reference-3" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;3&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;numberFormatString&lt;/code&gt; uses an interpolated string, in which &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;{branchWidth}&lt;/code&gt; will be replaced with the variable defined before. In the LINQ expression, you can see two interesting things: one is a two-argument lambda for &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;Select&lt;/code&gt;, and argument names, which can be optionally passed to functions and constructors for readability or to set parameters out of order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How much boilerplate do you need to define an immutable data class with a constructor, value equality, and a string representation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly zero:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(If you want things to be mutable, you do need to write some more code. Still, all you need for encapsulated properties is &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;int Foo { get; set; }&lt;/code&gt;, which is miles better than having to write out getters and setters by hand, as you would do in Java.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Dependency management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gitco.NET is a fairly simple thing, and it doesn’t need any third-party libraries, it can do its job with just the standard library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Gitco.NET has a test suite. .NET doesn’t ship with a unit testing framework. There are three popular options, I picked xUnit (which is the most popular). I created the test project with a template, and then added a reference to the main code (under test). I ended up with the following project file (&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;gitco.NET.Tests.csproj&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a id="rest_code_cc1aeec9684848b9bdf26a0883b35c6e-26" name="rest_code_cc1aeec9684848b9bdf26a0883b35c6e-26" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2022/09/19/writing-a-console-app-in-c-sharp-for-fun-and-profit/#rest_code_cc1aeec9684848b9bdf26a0883b35c6e-26"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/ItemGroup&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a id="rest_code_cc1aeec9684848b9bdf26a0883b35c6e-27" name="rest_code_cc1aeec9684848b9bdf26a0883b35c6e-27" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2022/09/19/writing-a-console-app-in-c-sharp-for-fun-and-profit/#rest_code_cc1aeec9684848b9bdf26a0883b35c6e-27"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a id="rest_code_cc1aeec9684848b9bdf26a0883b35c6e-28" name="rest_code_cc1aeec9684848b9bdf26a0883b35c6e-28" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2022/09/19/writing-a-console-app-in-c-sharp-for-fun-and-profit/#rest_code_cc1aeec9684848b9bdf26a0883b35c6e-28"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="nt"&gt;&amp;lt;/Project&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it’s an XML file. But it’s pretty straightforward: there’s a &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;lt;PropertyGroup&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; with some project configuration, and two &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;lt;ItemGroup&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags. One of them has &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;lt;PackageReference&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags, which specify third-party dependencies to use. The other has a &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;lt;ProjectReference&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; to the main code, pointing at its &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;.csproj&lt;/code&gt; file. (Note that this split is arbitrary, you can have as many &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;lt;ItemGroup&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags as you want, you could have just one with both package and project references.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does this work? Quite simply, and transparently to the developer. Building the project will lead to packages being &lt;em&gt;restored&lt;/em&gt; (fetched from NuGet, or copied from the local NuGet cache). There are no “virtual environments” to manage, there aren’t 10 competing package managers. Visual Studio will also expect both projects to be part of one solution, which is something you’d likely do anyway for convenient access to both at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="tooling"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tooling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;section id="dotnet-cli"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;dotnet CLI&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.NET has a CLI for performing typical build and project configuration tasks. You can &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;dotnet build&lt;/code&gt; a project, you can &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;dotnet run&lt;/code&gt; it, you can &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;dotnet test&lt;/code&gt; things, and you can &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;dotnet publish&lt;/code&gt;. The CLI figures out what to do, it restores the dependencies if needed, it handles the compilation of your code. If you type &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;dotnet test&lt;/code&gt; in a directory with your solution file (&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;.sln&lt;/code&gt;), it will restore dependencies, build the code, and then find tests and run them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="ide"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;IDE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What IDE should you use? There are a few options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visual Studio Code.&lt;/strong&gt; The quite advanced text editor supports pretty much any language. C# support works okay, with all the IDE features available, but in my experience, it can sometimes get confused (requiring a restart of the IDE). You will probably need to spend some more time with the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;dotnet&lt;/code&gt; CLI than you would with the other options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visual Studio for Windows.&lt;/strong&gt; The IDE with the purple icon is an option, although VS can feel arcane to people used to other IDEs/editors, and the Vim bindings are quite bad (especially if you select things with a mouse sometimes). It’s free for personal and very-small-business use, but for anything even slightly serious, you’ll need paid licenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visual Studio for Mac.&lt;/strong&gt; A completely separate product, works reasonably well, same pricing as with the Windows version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visual Studio for Windows + ReSharper Ultimate.&lt;/strong&gt; Adding this (paid) extension makes VS much smarter, although it can also affect performance negatively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JetBrains Rider.&lt;/strong&gt; This is an IDE based on the IntelliJ platform, with all the magic seen in ReSharper (as well as other JetBrains IDEs), but none of the performance issues and Visual Studio being Visual Studio (although if you do prefer VS behaviors and keyboard shortcuts, you can configure those as well). This is probably your best bet if you’re willing to invest some money (or your employer is).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="why-should-i-pick-it-over-x"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why should I pick it over X?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it depends. If this post has piqued your interest, perhaps install the SDK and write some small things to get a feel for the language and to see if it’s for you. (And note this post didn’t cover the Web stuff.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here are a few things of note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="python"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Python&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;C# is statically typed. Modern Python’s static typing (via things like mypy) is quite cool, but not all libraries and ecosystems have adopted it. Statically typed languages are safer, and allow IDEs to be smarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;C# has a better approach to functional programming. Python has ugly and single-expression lambdas (with a pointless &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;lambda&lt;/code&gt; keyword), C# has inline functions that can contain multiple statements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;C# has much better package management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;C# is trivial to compile to a single-file executable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;C# is much faster than Python.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;~Nobody does machine learning and data science in C#, which is a plus in my book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="java"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Java&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;C# has a lot more developer-quality-of-life features and less boilerplate. For example, Lists and Dictionaries can be accessed using brackets, and properties are accessible via dot notation instead of having to explicitly call getter and setter methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;C#’s generic are more flexible, as they aren’t erased on compilation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;C# has null safety. It also has the safe navigation &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;?.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; operator, and the null coalescing &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;??&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; operator, both of which make working with nullable values easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;C# has easy concurrency via &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;await&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Web stuff: Spring is painful, Spring Boot doesn’t make it much better. ASP.NET Core is much nicer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Additional reading:&lt;/em&gt; Wikipedia has a very nice and detailed &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_C_Sharp_and_Java"&gt;Comparison of C# and Java&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="also"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Also…&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;C# is a high-level language with automated memory management, which is very convenient in many use-cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;C# has exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are quite a lot of jobs for C# developers, although not necessarily in Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="but-on-the-other-hand"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;But on the other hand…&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;C# can still sometimes feel a bit Windows-oriented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;C# jobs tend to be enterprisey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Python is a great language to learn as a beginner. It’s also great for one-off things, interactive work, and scripting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The non-Windows desktop GUI story isn’t too great, although it is getting better with MAUI (which supports macOS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re targeting mobile, I would probably focus on the native APIs and languages for the best user experience (Swift and Cocoa Touch for iOS; Kotlin and the Android Platform APIs for Android). That said, MAUI might be worth a go as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re doing very low-level stuff, C# probably won’t cut it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want real functional programming, go with F#. You might also prefer Scala or Haskell or such.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if you’re making web front-end stuff, TypeScript (or plain JavaScript) is still your best bet. C# has Blazor, but I’d prefer for web apps not to embed all of .NET via WebAssembly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for console apps, Windows desktop, and web back-end services? &lt;strong&gt;Do give C# a try,&lt;/strong&gt; it might just win you over. It is a pretty good language, but one that was held back by the Windows association for a long time. But now it’s part of a modern, multi-platform, developer-friendly ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="footnotes"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Footnotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;aside class="footnote-list brackets"&gt;
&lt;aside class="footnote brackets" id="footnote-1" role="doc-footnote"&gt;
&lt;span class="label"&gt;&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a role="doc-backlink" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2022/09/19/writing-a-console-app-in-c-sharp-for-fun-and-profit/#footnote-reference-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code samples in this post are using the usual Microsoft code style with braces on separate lines, the usual Microsoft naming convention (PascalCase for ~everything, camelCase for local variable names), and 2-space indentation, which isn’t the usual Microsoft style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;aside class="footnote brackets" id="footnote-2" role="doc-footnote"&gt;
&lt;span class="label"&gt;&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a role="doc-backlink" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2022/09/19/writing-a-console-app-in-c-sharp-for-fun-and-profit/#footnote-reference-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could be moved to a separate static method. If that method was &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;private static Branch ParseLineAsBranch(string branchLine)&lt;/code&gt;, then the expression could be &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;.Select(ParseLineAsBranch)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;aside class="footnote brackets" id="footnote-3" role="doc-footnote"&gt;
&lt;span class="label"&gt;&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a role="doc-backlink" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2022/09/19/writing-a-console-app-in-c-sharp-for-fun-and-profit/#footnote-reference-3"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s some inconsistency and mixing when working with nullables: nullable objects (such as &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;string?&lt;/code&gt;) are accessible directly, whereas nullable value types (such as &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;int?&lt;/code&gt;) need to be accessed with &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;.Value&lt;/code&gt;, due to historical reasons and implementation details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;</description><guid>https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2022/09/19/writing-a-console-app-in-c-sharp-for-fun-and-profit/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 19 Sep 2022 20:35:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Enabling Virtualization Support in Boot Camp with rEFInd</title><link>https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2021/01/31/enabling-virtualization-support-in-boot-camp-with-refind/</link><dc:creator>Chris Warrick</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;You installed Windows on an Intel Mac via Boot Camp, and want to use
virtualization in it. But there’s an issue — hardware virtualization extensions
are not available. Luckily, this can be worked around easily with the help of
rEFInd, an alternate boot manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many software development workflows involve virtualization. WSL, Docker for
Windows, and the Android Emulator are some examples of common
virtualization-based tools. Then there are general virtualization
tools/hypervisors, such as VMware Workstation, Hyper-V or VirtualBox. All these
tools require hardware virtualization extensions (Intel VT-x, AMD-V) or at
least are very slow without them. Virtualization extensions are not enabled by
default in the CPU, they must be enabled by something. On typical PCs, this is
often a firmware-level setting (that might be disabled by default), or it might
be unconditionally enabled by the firmware. On a Mac, however, enabling VT-x is
done by macOS, as part of the boot process. This means that Windows running in
Boot Camp will start without virtualization, unless you want to boot into macOS
first and then reboot into Windows. That setup isn’t quite ergonomic (and what
if macOS refuses to shut down, as it often does for me?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, we’re going to use
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/"&gt;rEFInd&lt;/a&gt;, a boot manager for
EFI-based systems that can boot into various OSes and also handle other
parts of the boot process. But first, let’s prepare our system for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="lead"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DISCLAIMER:&lt;/strong&gt; Those steps may make your Mac fail to boot. I don’t take any
responsibility whatsoever if that happens. Prepare for the worst — make
backups, perhaps have install media ready, plan some downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="step-1-install-windows-in-boot-camp-the-usual-way"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 1. Install Windows in Boot Camp the usual way&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing you should do is install Windows 10 in Boot Camp, with
the help of the Boot Camp Assistant. The Assistant will take some time
to partition your drive and do other preparations (and show barely
informative progress bars, but &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2020/06/03/reinstalling-macos-what-to-try-when-all-else-fails/#an-open-letter-to-progress-bar-designers"&gt;I ranted about that Apple design “feature”
already&lt;/a&gt;).
There are no special preparations for this, the standard process will
work. If you already have Windows installed, you can go to the next
step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="step-2-ensure-the-setup-is-stable"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 2. Ensure the setup is stable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll be making changes to how the machine boots, and as such, it’s
good to have other things working correctly and in line with your
expected configuration. Make sure that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both macOS and Windows boot correctly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can change the OS you boot into by holding the Option key after
pressing Power (requires disabling the firmware password &lt;a class="brackets" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2021/01/31/enabling-virtualization-support-in-boot-camp-with-refind/#footnote-1" id="footnote-reference-1" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;1&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disk encryption (FileVault, BitLocker) is enabled (if you want that, of
course) and fully configured (initial encryption is complete)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows setup (including Boot Camp drivers) is complete&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;OSXRESERVED&lt;/code&gt; partition that the Boot Camp Assistant created
has been deleted (that should have happened when booting into macOS for the
first time after installing Windows — complete with a slowly moving
progress bar and no other information, as is usual for this OS — but
if that didn’t happen, use Disk Utility in macOS or Recovery OS to do
that — pick your drive, click &lt;em&gt;Partition&lt;/em&gt; and delete the partition,
this will grow the macOS partition)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;System Integrity Protection is enabled (the procedure is a bit safer
that way)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="step-3-create-a-partition-for-refind"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 3. Create a partition for rEFInd&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, back up your data before making changes to your hard drive
layout. We’ll need to create a new partition for rEFInd to live on. This
is the safest option — you could install it to the EFI System Partition (ESP),
but macOS might want to put its own stuff there, and it’s safer not to
use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rEFInd partition doesn’t need to be large (50 MB will be enough); it must use the HFS+ (Mac OS
Extended) file system. To create it, you have three options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;From macOS, by shrinking the macOS partition: open Disk Utility,
choose your drive, select Partition, add a new partition, set its
size and file system (in that order!). This will take a few minutes
(10-15, or possibly more), and you won’t be able to use your Mac
during the resize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Recovery OS, by shrinking the macOS partition: same steps apply,
but it might be a bit safer than doing it from within macOS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;From Windows, by shrinking the Windows partition: open Disk
Management (press the Windows key and type &lt;em&gt;partition&lt;/em&gt;, or open
Computer Management from Administrative Tools), right click your
Windows partition, select Shrink Volume. Enter the desired size and
click Shrink. Then, right click the unallocated space and create a
New Simple Volume. For now, choose FAT32 or exFAT; you’ll need to
reformat it as HFS+ from within macOS later (&lt;em&gt;Erase&lt;/em&gt; in Disk Utility). This
will take a few seconds — and even if you include the time to reboot, it’s
faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you create the new partition and make sure it’s HFS+ (Mac OS
Extended), you can proceed with the setup. Also, if you don’t want the
partition to be visible in the Finder, run the following command (insert
the correct volume path for your system):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code text"&gt;&lt;a id="rest_code_ced81f3b8c5b419bafe9eb720d720759-1" name="rest_code_ced81f3b8c5b419bafe9eb720d720759-1" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2021/01/31/enabling-virtualization-support-in-boot-camp-with-refind/#rest_code_ced81f3b8c5b419bafe9eb720d720759-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;sudo chflags hidden /Volumes/rEFInd
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="step-4-configure-and-install-refind"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Step 4. Configure and install rEFInd&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To set ue rEFInd, you’ll need to boot into macOS. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/getting.html"&gt;Download
rEFInd&lt;/a&gt; from the
author’s website — you want the file named &lt;em&gt;A binary zip file&lt;/em&gt;. Extract
this archive anywhere on your system (&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;~/Downloads&lt;/code&gt; is fine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, you’ll need to change the configuration file
&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;refind/refind.conf-sample&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Locate the setting named
&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;enable_and_lock_vmx&lt;/code&gt;, uncomment it (remove the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; at the start
of the line), and set its value to &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;. You can also make other
configuration changes — the default &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;timeout&lt;/code&gt; of 20 seconds is
likely to be too much for your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your configuration file is ready, you can install rEFInd. You can
use the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;refind-install&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tool, or perform a manual install (check
out the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/installing.html"&gt;installation
docs&lt;/a&gt; for more
details).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before installing, you’ll need to get the device name of your rEFInd
partition. Open Disk Utility, select the partition from the left pane,
and check the &lt;em&gt;Device&lt;/em&gt; field (for example, &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;disk9s9&lt;/code&gt; — it will be
&lt;strong&gt;different&lt;/strong&gt; on your system, depending on your partition layout).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open a Terminal, &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; into the directory where rEFInd was extracted,
and run the following command (replace &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;disk9s9&lt;/code&gt; with the device
name on your system):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code text"&gt;&lt;a id="rest_code_758945892f264b38b6cd798c1e179784-1" name="rest_code_758945892f264b38b6cd798c1e179784-1" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2021/01/31/enabling-virtualization-support-in-boot-camp-with-refind/#rest_code_758945892f264b38b6cd798c1e179784-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;./refind-install --ownhfs disk9s9
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This command will produce an error if you have SIP enabled — but this
error is not important for us, the install will work without the change
that SIP prevented. &lt;a class="brackets" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2021/01/31/enabling-virtualization-support-in-boot-camp-with-refind/#footnote-2" id="footnote-reference-2" role="doc-noteref"&gt;&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;2&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can now shut down your Mac and use the Option key while starting up
to choose the OS. You should see three options: Macintosh HD, EFI Boot,
and Boot Camp. The EFI Boot option is rEFInd — pick that, boot into
Windows (Microsoft EFI boot), &lt;em&gt;et voilà&lt;/em&gt; — Windows can now run virtualization software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few more things that you can do now, depending on your OS
preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can make rEFInd the default boot loader. Hold &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt; on the
Apple boot device selection screen and click the Power icon under the
EFI Boot drive (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/73742"&gt;source for the
tip&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can use rEFInd to boot into macOS, although this might not work
with Big Sur according to the author (it seems to work for me, but
YMMV). You can use the standard boot method for macOS (by defaulting
to Macintosh HD, or by choosing it from the Power+Option picker) and
rEFInd exclusively for Windows (and set your timeout to a low value).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can modify rEFInd’s configuration — in this scenario, the config
file is &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;/Volumes/rEFInd/System/Library/CoreServices/refind.conf&lt;/code&gt;.
You can set a custom background image, for example (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/"&gt;rEFInd’s
site&lt;/a&gt; can help you figure out
what options are available and what you can set them to).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;aside class="footnote-list brackets"&gt;
&lt;aside class="footnote brackets" id="footnote-1" role="doc-footnote"&gt;
&lt;span class="label"&gt;&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a role="doc-backlink" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2021/01/31/enabling-virtualization-support-in-boot-camp-with-refind/#footnote-reference-1"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the firmware password is important to you, you can restore it after
the setup is done — this will mean using rEFInd to boot both Windows and
macOS, although I decided to remove the firmware password and boot
into macOS from the Power+Option boot menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;aside class="footnote brackets" id="footnote-2" role="doc-footnote"&gt;
&lt;span class="label"&gt;&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a role="doc-backlink" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2021/01/31/enabling-virtualization-support-in-boot-camp-with-refind/#footnote-reference-2"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="fn-bracket"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The failing operation is marking the rEFInd partition bootable in the Mac
sense, using the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;bless&lt;/code&gt; command. However, the drive is considered
bootable as an EFI-compliant boot volume (it has &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;*.efi&lt;/code&gt; files in specific
places), and this is the boot method we’re using here. SIP aside, the
&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;bless&lt;/code&gt; utility is a bit buggy, and we can use rEFInd without a blessed
partition just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;

transition Macs to ARM processors. These news have some side effects for
software developers, particularly those not working with the Apple ecosystem.
And they also affect people who depend on both macOS and Windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I am not going to focus in the differences between x86_64 and ARM,
RISC and CISC, and all the benchmarks. Let’s assume that Apple manages to offer
ARM-based CPUs that can match performance of most Intel processors in Apple’s
lineup, and let’s even assume they can make an ARM Mac Pro. (A note on naming:
Apple Silicon is the official name, but it sounds ugly. I’ll just call it ARM.
For Intel, I’ll use either Intel or x86(_64).)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many users, the transition will be more-or-less transparent. Sure, they’ll
lose some apps, just like they probably did with Catalina (which dropped
support for 32-bit Intel apps), or some apps will not be available/will be
buggy in the first few months of the transition (though it will be easier than
the PowerPC transition, because Apple uses little-endian byte order on ARM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="how-will-it-work-out-in-apple-land"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2020/06/22/what-an-arm-mac-means-for-developers-and-windows-users/#toc-entry-1" role="doc-backlink"&gt;How will it work out in Apple land?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For developers who work only on iOS apps, the transition also won’t mean much.
Maybe a faster, more accurate Simulator. They’ll need to buy an ARM Mac sooner
or later (within the next 5 years), because Apple requires them to use the
latest Xcode version for App Store submissions, and Xcode supports at best the
previous version of macOS.  But that has been Apple’s policy forever, and the
Intel Macs will probably be within the usual deprecation range when that
happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The requirements for macOS-only developers are pretty obvious, they will need
to buy an ARM Mac on day one, so they can test their apps on the new platform.
They will also need to work on ARM compatibility — although updating your app
for the new OS is a yearly ritual in Apple land, so that’s also mostly
business-as-usual (unless you do a lot of unportable low-level stuff in your
code). There are some pro apps that tend to lag behind new Apple decrees (some
might have been hit by Catalina), and users of those apps might prefer to stay
with Intel for a little bit longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, we get to the requirements of developers who use Macs, but don’t work
exclusively with the Apple platforms. This is a fairly large group, since many
developers like Macs for the good hardware, Unix-based software, and the
integration of both. And for some part, non-developers are affected too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="who-needs-non-apple-operating-systems"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2020/06/22/what-an-arm-mac-means-for-developers-and-windows-users/#toc-entry-2" role="doc-backlink"&gt;Who needs non-Apple operating systems?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first group are people tied to Windows, somehow. Some of them might be
using Boot Camp to play games. Others might be using Boot Camp or
virtualization software (Parallels Desktop, VMware Fusion, Oracle VM
VirtualBox) to run Windows and Windows-specific apps — perhaps they need the
Windows version of Office, or various Windows-onlypro apps, or they need
Windows to file their taxes, because their government does not care about
non-Windows OSes. Or perhaps they’re web developers, and they need to test
compatibility with the Windows versions of browsers, or the old Microsoft
browsers (IE and pre-Chromium Edge).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second group is software developers who need Linux. While macOS provides a
very competent development environment, and many things can be run directly on
macOS, some use-cases may require a Linux VM.  Perhaps the most notable case is
Docker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Docker is a solution for lightweight app containers, that can offer separation
between apps, and that can simplify and standardize deployment. Docker itself
is not a virtualization solution (at least in the traditional sense). Docker
must run on top of Linux (there’s also Docker-on-Windows, but that’s another
story). The Docker Desktop for Mac app runs a lightweight Linux VM, and runs
containers in that VM. The virtualization solution &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/docker/for-mac"&gt;Docker for Mac uses&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;Hypervisor.framework&lt;/code&gt;, which is
part of macOS itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who else needs virtualization? Android developers. The Android Emulator is also
a virtual machine that runs the Android operating system. Android can run on
different architectures, and so, a x86 system image is typically used for the
Emulator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="is-virtualization-possible-on-arm"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2020/06/22/what-an-arm-mac-means-for-developers-and-windows-users/#toc-entry-3" role="doc-backlink"&gt;Is virtualization possible on ARM?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, definitely. Apple has been testing it much earlier, since the
aforementioned &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;Hypervisor.framework&lt;/code&gt; was found &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/never_released/status/1250533740557852674"&gt;on iOS in April&lt;/a&gt;.
And Apple announced virtualization support for ARM Macs during the keynote, and
showed an example of a Linux VM. That VM was, of course, running an ARM64
distribution of Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what can we use this for? Turns out, it’s complicated. The easiest thing
from the few use-cases mentioned before is Android. Google just needs to get
the Emulator working on ARM Macs and ship that to the devs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about Linux in general? Many mainstream distributions
support ARM64, so that’s not a problem in general. The support for a particular
distro or software might be worse than on x86_64, but it’s generally not a
problem for users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But for Docker, there’s a problem. One of the many advantages of Docker is
dev-prod parity. If you deploy your app with Docker to an x86_64 Linux server,
you can also install Docker on an x86_64 Linux developer machine (or a Linux VM on an
Intel Mac/Windows PC). Both the server and the dev machine can run &lt;strong&gt;the same&lt;/strong&gt;
image, the same code, the same configuration. That won’t happen if they are a
different architecture. This means that you can end up with bugs happening
because of different environments, and it’s also possible that some images you
depend on are not available for both architectures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then we get to Windows. Windows also has an ARM version, but it’s currently
available only with a new ARM device (you can’t buy it standalone). If
Microsoft were to sell this, we’d have an issue with the software. Windows 10
on ARM supports 32/64-bit ARM software, and can run 32-bit Intel (x86) software
using emulation. It cannot, however, emulate apps that require 64-bit Intel
processors (x86_64).  This makes the software situation on that platform a bit
better. While many developers don’t care about ARM and might not have builds
for ARM available, most Windows software is available in both x86 and x86_64
versions, or is exclusively 32-bit. But certain pro apps are x86_64 only, so if
there is no ARM build of it, an ARM Windows PC currently cannot run it.
(&lt;em&gt;Update:&lt;/em&gt; Microsoft announced &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2020/09/30/now-more-essential-than-ever-the-role-of-the-windows-pc-has-changed/"&gt;x86_64 emulation on ARM&lt;/a&gt;,
which means more software will work.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And note that Microsoft knows about the transition, but we haven’t heard
anything about Windows during the keynote…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="can-we-emulate-x86-64-and-run-x86-64-windows-10"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2020/06/22/what-an-arm-mac-means-for-developers-and-windows-users/#toc-entry-4" role="doc-backlink"&gt;Can we emulate x86(_64) and run x86(_64) Windows 10?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theoretically? Yes. Practically? No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue with emulation is speed. There are a few x86 emulators available, and
those emulators can be run on an ARM device just fine. You can find videos on
YouTube (not a very reliable source of information, I know) in which people try
to benchmark those, or try to run Windows using an emulator like that. And even
with an ancient Windows version, the emulation is painfully slow. Windows 10
would be basically unusable if you tried to emulate all of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does the x86 emulation on Windows 10 for ARM work? You can watch &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2017/P4171"&gt;the
Channel 9 video about Windows 10 on ARM&lt;/a&gt; (around 6:00) for more
details. The trick is that system DLLs are using a hybrid x86/ARM64 library
format, which means x86 code can call those DLLs at native speeds. This means
that many apps run at near-native speed (depending on the ratio of custom code
to system DLL calls). This technique cannot work for emulating the entire
operating system. If Windows 10 on ARM was made available for ARM Macs, running
x86 Windows apps would become feasible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosetta probably uses similar technique. Most apps will be translated at
install time, not at run time. But you can’t do that with an entire OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="whats-next-for-people-who-rely-on-both-macos-and-windows"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2020/06/22/what-an-arm-mac-means-for-developers-and-windows-users/#toc-entry-5" role="doc-backlink"&gt;What’s next for people who rely on both macOS and Windows?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a few more years, Intel Macs will still be supported by Apple (with new
macOS versions) and by software vendors. But after that? Well, you’re stuck
with two machines, at least until Windows on ARM becomes viable and runnable on
Macs. Or you can start exploring alternatives to macOS software. If you’re one
of the macOS-as-UNIX-with-great-UX developers (hello!), perhaps you’ll have to
switch to Linux — or perhaps Windows with Windows Subsystem for Linux? (The
latter is becoming more usable with every Windows release, so keep an eye on
that… I wrote this post in NeoVim in WSL2, with Windows Terminal supporting
many advanced terminal features, and the transparent filesystem integration
letting me access Windows files directly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="post-m1-announcement-update-2020-11-14"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2020/06/22/what-an-arm-mac-means-for-developers-and-windows-users/#toc-entry-6" role="doc-backlink"&gt;Post-M1 announcement update (2020-11-14)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parallels have confirmed &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.parallels.com/blogs/parallels-desktop-apple-silicon-mac/"&gt;support for M1 Macs&lt;/a&gt; and
are offering a Technical Preview of their M1 virtualization product. This
announcement’s mention of Windows 10 ARM supporting x86_64 apps has caused
some tech writers to assume Parallels will support Windows 10 ARM on M1
Macs. This is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; what the post says. Parallels is not, and cannot
announce support for that OS, because Windows 10 ARM is (still) available to
ARM OEMs only to install on their devices — making an official announcement
about this feature today would be admitting to doing something illegal/not
allowed by the EULA. I’m pretty sure they are not working on support for
Windows 10 ARM now and in the foreseeable future, until Microsoft opens up
Windows 10 ARM to the public — their own legal issues aside, who would they sell
the Windows support to?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other news, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/4733"&gt;Docker is not ready yet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;
&lt;section id="making-install-media-with-el-capitan-with-access-only-to-recovery"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2020/06/03/reinstalling-macos-what-to-try-when-all-else-fails/#toc-entry-1" role="doc-backlink"&gt;Making install media with El Capitan (with access only to Recovery)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best, safest, least error-prone way to do an install is with a USB stick.
Unfortunately, making a USB stick with the macOS installer on it is a nuisance.
The expected way to produce macOS install media is to download the installer
from App Store/Software Update, and run the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;createinstallmedia&lt;/code&gt; command-line
program included with that installer app. All is well, as long as macOS works.
If it doesn’t, and Recovery can’t install it for you, that can be difficult to
solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple does not make macOS images publicly available. That’s probably to make
Hackintoshing this little bit harder, but this also affects legitimate users.
The only thing you can easily download from Apple is El Capitan. Apple offers
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206886"&gt;InstallMacOSX.dmg&lt;/a&gt; on their
website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also some other downloads available:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;there’s a Sierra download, with a broken link, although it can be fixed by changing &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;updates-http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;updates&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://updates.cdn-apple.com/2019/cert/061-39476-20191023-48f365f4-0015-4c41-9f44-39d3d2aca067/InstallOS.dmg"&gt;get Sierra installer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;if you need something older than El Capitan, downloads are available as far
back as Lion, although these might not have the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;createinstallmedia&lt;/code&gt; tool
required for this procedure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post assumes you’re working with El Capitan; a quick look though that file
suggests the instructions in this post should work with Sierra as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you take a look at the instructions, you will see that this is
&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a bootable OS X image. This image has a &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;.pkg&lt;/code&gt; package. This package is
expected to install &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;/Applications/Install OS X El Capitan.app&lt;/code&gt;. Well, we’re
in recovery, we can’t install stuff. So, let’s do this the manual way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="manually-installing-pkg-files"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2020/06/03/reinstalling-macos-what-to-try-when-all-else-fails/#toc-entry-2" role="doc-backlink"&gt;Manually installing .pkg files&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;.pkg&lt;/code&gt; format is just an archives all the way down, with all
archives being different formats (at least three).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside class="float-md-right mt-md-0 sidebar"&gt;
&lt;p class="sidebar-title"&gt;macOS flat package format&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find more resources about the flat package format, &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://s.sudre.free.fr/Stuff/Ivanhoe/FLAT.html"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://matthew-brett.github.io/docosx/flat_packages.html#payload_"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt;, although
this was deduced from the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;file&lt;/code&gt; command and The Unarchiver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first archive is the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;.pkg&lt;/code&gt; file itself. Those files are in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xar_(archiver)"&gt;XAR format&lt;/a&gt;, which was invented by the
OpenDarwin community. You can either extract it with &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;pkgutil &lt;span class="pre"&gt;--expand&lt;/span&gt;
foo.pkg foo_files&lt;/code&gt; (the last argument is the destination directory, can be
anything, will be created by &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;pkgutil&lt;/code&gt;) if you have access to that command (it’s
available in Recovery OS), or you can try the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;xar&lt;/code&gt; utility as &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;xar &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-xf&lt;/span&gt;
foo.pkg&lt;/code&gt;. The structure produced by both tools is a bit different, but we can
work with both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second archive-in-archive is the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;Payload&lt;/code&gt;. It’s a gzipped cpio archive
that contains the files installed by this package.  If you have BSD tar
(default on macOS, easily installable on Linux), you can just do &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;tar &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-xvf&lt;/span&gt; Payload&lt;/code&gt;.
Otherwise, you can use &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;gunzip &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-c&lt;/span&gt; Payload | cpio &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;gzcat&lt;/code&gt;). That
will extract all the files the package has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another nested archive is the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;Scripts&lt;/code&gt; archive, although note that
&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;pkgutil&lt;/code&gt; will extract it automatically. If it’s not extracted, it’s actually
&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;.cpio.gz&lt;/code&gt; again, with the same way to extract it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(PS.  If you have &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;7z&lt;/code&gt; around (on Windows/Linux as well), you can just point
it at all the compressed files mentioned in this paragraph.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve got the installer app, which is what we need to create an install image.
Great, let’s try it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code console"&gt;&lt;a id="rest_code_fc1d1866ed2d46fda708d07b117f5172-1" name="rest_code_fc1d1866ed2d46fda708d07b117f5172-1" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2020/06/03/reinstalling-macos-what-to-try-when-all-else-fails/#rest_code_fc1d1866ed2d46fda708d07b117f5172-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;# &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Install OS X El Capitan.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--volume&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/Volumes/MyBlankUSBDrive&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;--applicationpath&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Install OS X El Capitan.app"&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a id="rest_code_fc1d1866ed2d46fda708d07b117f5172-2" name="rest_code_fc1d1866ed2d46fda708d07b117f5172-2" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2020/06/03/reinstalling-macos-what-to-try-when-all-else-fails/#rest_code_fc1d1866ed2d46fda708d07b117f5172-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="go"&gt;Install OS X El Capitan.app does not appear to be a valid OS installer application.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, we’ve got a problem. Turns out there’s one more thing we need to take care
of, and it’s the scripts. MacOS packages have scripts, typically shell scripts,
that are run at various stages in the install process. We can look at the
&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;PackageInfo&lt;/code&gt; file, or just look in the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;Scripts&lt;/code&gt; folder, to see that
there’s an &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;link_package&lt;/code&gt; script we need to run. This script creates a
&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;Contents/SharedSupport&lt;/code&gt; directory inside the installer app, and
copies/hardlinks the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;InstallESD.dmg&lt;/code&gt; file (which is the install formerly-DVD
image) to that directory. Let’s try doing this on our own:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code console"&gt;&lt;a id="rest_code_0afb9add548c402b85289aaeb5a7fc14-1" name="rest_code_0afb9add548c402b85289aaeb5a7fc14-1" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2020/06/03/reinstalling-macos-what-to-try-when-all-else-fails/#rest_code_0afb9add548c402b85289aaeb5a7fc14-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;mkdir&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"Install OS X El Capitan.app/Contents/SharedSupport"&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it works! &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;createinstallmedia&lt;/code&gt; will now produce valid install media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="b-installer-from-recovery-app-store-any-macos-version"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2020/06/03/reinstalling-macos-what-to-try-when-all-else-fails/#toc-entry-5" role="doc-backlink"&gt;b. Installer from Recovery/App Store (any macOS version)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are in Recovery, you can find an Install app on the filesystem. If you
try to run it, you will get the same error as in the previous paragraph:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code text"&gt;&lt;a id="rest_code_965b113ebd9146cf8cb91e93894a4dab-1" name="rest_code_965b113ebd9146cf8cb91e93894a4dab-1" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2020/06/03/reinstalling-macos-what-to-try-when-all-else-fails/#rest_code_965b113ebd9146cf8cb91e93894a4dab-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Install macOS Catalina.app does not appear to be a valid OS installer application.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also happens with some older macOS versions, where you get a small
&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;.app&lt;/code&gt; from the App Store, and that app does the actual download.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever the issue was, we need to download the install files with the
installer. Open the installer and let it run until the download finishes. If
the app asks you to reboot, quit it at this point. If it never asks, you can
still find a way to get files out (after a failed install, they should not be
removed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The install files can be found in &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;/macOS Install Data&lt;/code&gt; on the destination
volume. For older versions, you will just have &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;InstallESD.dmg&lt;/code&gt;, newer
versions add more and more files, some of which are hardware-specific (and
Catalina has &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;InstallESDDmg.pkg&lt;/code&gt;, because Apple loves nesting archives for no
reason!). However many files you find, you can just:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copy &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;Install macOS Catalina.app&lt;/code&gt; to a read-write volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copy the contents of &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;/Volumes/TARGET/macOS Install Data&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;Install
macOS Catalina.app/Content/SharedSupport&lt;/code&gt;. Make sure you account for hidden
files, if any (copy the entire directory). If you did this correctly,
&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;InstallESDDmg.pkg&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;InstallESD.dmg&lt;/code&gt; on older verisons) is in the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;SharedSupport&lt;/code&gt;
directory (not in a subdirectory).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;createinstallmedia&lt;/code&gt;. It should now consider the installer valid. The
available options differ slightly depending on the OS version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;section id="bonus-tidbit-1-how-the-download-works"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2020/06/03/reinstalling-macos-what-to-try-when-all-else-fails/#toc-entry-7" role="doc-backlink"&gt;Bonus tidbit 1: how the download works&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While messing with all the installer stuff, I found out a few
interesting/worrying things about the download process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one is that the macOS installer uses plain HTTP without encryption to
download files. That opens you to all the standard issues — an attacker can
replace files you download, and the protocol doesn’t do anything to detect
errors (the installer will verify files, but where do the checksums come
from?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second one is how the download happens. You might have noticed it to be a
bit slower than usual traffic. The download happens in 10 MB chunks, using the
&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;Range&lt;/code&gt; HTTP header. The installer asks for 10 MB, gets it, saves, asks for
another chunk. Repeat that over 800 times, and the overhead of the entire HTTP
dance becomes noticeable. (I haven’t checked, but I hope the installer at least
uses Keep-Alive. I wouldn’t be particularly surprised if it didn’t, though.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this raises another question. The servers clearly support partial downloads.
And yet, if your network disconnects during the download, your download
progress for that file is reset, and in Catalina, you can go from 8 GB back to
500 MB if you’re particularly unlucky. The question is, why? This
infrastructure should make it trivial to continue the download, perhaps
discarding the most recent chunk if you’re concerned about that download of it
being unsuccessful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="bonus-tidbit-2-using-terminal-from-setup-assistant"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2020/06/03/reinstalling-macos-what-to-try-when-all-else-fails/#toc-entry-8" role="doc-backlink"&gt;Bonus tidbit 2: using Terminal from Setup Assistant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time you boot a Mac after a clean install, it starts the Setup
Assistant. This app asks for basic OS settings (locale, date/time, user
accounts), and also lets you restore user data from backups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, you might want to access the Terminal or Console from that screen.
You can do that with Ctrl + Opt + Cmd + T and Ctrl + Opt + Cmd + C respectively &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://chris-collins.io/2018/03/15/Using-Terminal-At-macOS-Setup-Assistant/"&gt;(source)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How could that come in handy? For example, if you want to check if the backup
drive still worked and if the process isn’t stuck (I wrote a test file and also
checked &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;top&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="bonus-tidbit-3-creating-an-image-of-the-install-media-might-not-work"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months later, in December, I upgraded to Big Sur and then installed Windows 10
alongside it in Boot Camp. I then did some more hacks, which led to
two unbootable OSes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the upgrade, I had prepared install media and used it to install (so
it wouldn’t fail, as it did last time), and made a &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;.dmg&lt;/code&gt; of it with Disk
Utility. (Also, Apple won’t tell you this, but you need to give Disk Utility
&lt;em&gt;Full Disk Access&lt;/em&gt; for disk imaging to work. Otherwise, you get a cryptic
error.) I erased the USB drive after installing, but hey, I could get it back.
I booted into Internet Recovery and restored my image. Big Sur failed to boot
and showed a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210901"&gt;🚫 sign&lt;/a&gt;. I tried
restoring my Catalina image from the previous reinstall, and that didn’t work
due to a size mismatch. I used a different USB drive than these months ago (I
didn’t have that one with me at the moment), and apparently the one I used had
a different size (both are marketed as 16 GB). The images could be mounted
fine, and &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;createinstallmedia&lt;/code&gt; should have worked, likely producing a
bootable drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="bonus-tidbit-4-dont-bother-restoring-a-time-machine-backup"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2020/06/03/reinstalling-macos-what-to-try-when-all-else-fails/#toc-entry-10" role="doc-backlink"&gt;Bonus tidbit 4: don’t bother restoring a Time Machine backup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time Machine is Apple’s magical backup solution. Time Machine saves snapshots
of your entire disk. It’s supposed to help restore files that were deleted or
changed in an unwanted way, or help you restore a full macOS install.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time Machine is great at file recovery, but none of my 3 system restore
attempts were successful. Attempt #1 was a full Time Machine System Restore,
from Recovery, back in June. It failed partway through, it couldn’t read
everything from the disk. There might have been underlying hardware issues with
that failure, so I had another attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attempt #2 was a Migration Assistant restore, as part of the initial setup.
This one succeeded, and things worked… except for one fairly important app.
This app requires online activation with the vendor, and it wouldn’t reactivate
after the install. Whatever the third-party vendor is doing didn’t like the
reinstall. I tried to nuke all the things in ~/Library related to their
software, and ran their nuke-everything uninstaller, but that didn’t work.
I reinstalled from scratch and copied over my files, settings and apps from the
Time Machine drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attempt #3 involved the System Restore again, this time for the December
reinstall. The hardware issues were all fixed in the meantime, so I went for a
Time Machine System Restore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue #1:&lt;/strong&gt; Internet Recovery booted into Catalina. There was an issue on Apple’s
side, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2020/12/30/no-more-big-sur-internet-recovery/"&gt;Big Sur was unavailable in Internet Recovery in December&lt;/a&gt;. TM
Recovery will not restore a backup created with a newer version of macOS than
you’re booted into, so I was forced to restore a slightly older Catalina
backup. (I spent most of my time in Windows during that weekend, so other than
the need to upgrade macOS to Big Sur again, I didn’t really lose any data due
to this.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue #2:&lt;/strong&gt; It wasted time computing an inaccurate size estimate. Before
restoring a backup, macOS first checks if it will fit on your drive. When it
does that, an indeterminate progress bar is shown. macOS won’t tell you the
result of that computation, but you can read the final value from the full
Installer Log (Cmd + L). On my Mac, the value was 96.2 GB. I was at the Mac
when it was getting close to that value. 94, 95, 96, 96.1, 96.2, 96.3… hold on
a second, 96.3 GB? Hopefully that’s just a bunch of extra things that are
installed from the system image directly, or something like that, right? Of
course, since the progress bar is based on the pre-computed size, it became
indeterminate and I couldn’t tell when it would end. 98, 100, 110, 120, 121.2
GB is where it ultimately ended. So, not only did it waste 20+ minutes
computing a size, it was off by 25 GB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue #3:&lt;/strong&gt; The restore didn’t work. The System Restore finished and claimed to
have succeeded, but macOS wouldn’t boot. It showed an &lt;em&gt;Unrecoverable error&lt;/em&gt;,
&lt;em&gt;SecurityAgent was unable to create requested mechanism&lt;/em&gt;. Most people who had a
similar error had it caused by a botched TeamViewer uninstall; I didn’t have
that installed, and it was referring to a different component. So, wipe and
fresh reinstall it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I copied my stuff from the TM drive, and it was acting weird. Some apps failed
to load their settings copied into Library, others started with a “Move to
/Applications?” prompt (even though they were in that directory). For some
reason, those files had some hidden attribute set on it. I worked around it by
putting files in a &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;.zip&lt;/code&gt; archive with Keka, and then unzipping them;
&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;xattr&lt;/code&gt; might also help. (The attribute was likely &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;com.apple.quarantine&lt;/code&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I got the Mac to work, I reinstalled Windows and set up rEFInd, and it
now works fine. (I only use rEFInd because I want virtualization in Windows,
and that doesn’t work unless you’re warm-rebooting from macOS. I don’t need
anything more advanced than the Option key boot menu, but Apple made me use a
third-party bootloader.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We now go back to the original post from June.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="an-open-letter-to-progress-bar-designers"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2020/06/03/reinstalling-macos-what-to-try-when-all-else-fails/#toc-entry-11" role="doc-backlink"&gt;An Open Letter to Progress Bar Designers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Progress Bar Designers: can you please make your progress bars
functional? The macOS progress bar might look sleek at just 7 px (non-Retina)/6
pt = 12 px (Retina) high, but at the same time, you’re looking at individual
pixels if you need to know if it works or if it’s stuck. I have had to point my
mouse cursor at the end of the filled-in part just to know if it’s working or
not. Or sometimes, put a piece of paper in front of my screen, because there is
no mouse cursor when macOS installs on the black screen. How to make
that progress bar easier to use and more informative? Just add numbers on top of
it. For long-running processes, I wouldn’t mind progress bars that said
“12.34%”. That specific Setup/Migration Assistant window should be changed (it
only has a remaining time estimate and transfer speed, it should also show
moved data/total size), but wouldn’t more things benefit from a clear
indication of the progress? Yes, perhaps it looks less sleek, perhaps it
requires more space for the bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just compare: which is easier to parse? Which is more informative?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="mb-3"&gt;
&lt;div class="progress" style="height: 6.5px; border-radius: 6.5px;"&gt;
  &lt;div class="progress-bar" role="progressbar" style="width: 42.42%;" aria-valuenow="42.42" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-3"&gt;
&lt;div class="progress" style="height: 20px; border-radius: 20px;"&gt;
  &lt;div class="progress-bar" role="progressbar" style="width: 42.42%;" aria-valuenow="42.42" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"&gt;42%&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-3"&gt;
&lt;div class="progress" style="height: 20px; border-radius: 20px;"&gt;
  &lt;div class="progress-bar" role="progressbar" style="width: 42.42%;" aria-valuenow="42.42" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"&gt;42.4%&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="mb-3"&gt;
&lt;div class="progress" style="height: 20px; border-radius: 20px;"&gt;
  &lt;div class="progress-bar" role="progressbar" style="width: 64.64%;" aria-valuenow="64.64" aria-valuemin="0" aria-valuemax="100"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div style="position: absolute; text-align: center; left: 0; right: 0; margin-top: 10px;"&gt;64.64% (6.7 GB/10 GB copied)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’d honestly be happy enough with option 2, at least it can be read easily and
you can remember the number instead of a vague position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="in-the-end"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class="toc-backref" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2020/06/03/reinstalling-macos-what-to-try-when-all-else-fails/#toc-entry-12" role="doc-backlink"&gt;In the end…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all this, I managed to get macOS Catalina installed. After various
failures in built-in El Capitan recovery and Catalina Internet Recovery, I first
installed El Capitan with this hack, then jumped to Mojave because I thought
the new Software Update would help (it didn’t, same installer, same
failed-to-extract-package issue), then made a Catalina USB stick, and it
finally clean-installed, but I was worried about the backup disk’s operation,
and I used a proxy on my local network to try and speed up Catalina downloads
without much improvement… but hey, at least it works. Apple should really make
it easier to install their OS and to make boot media even when stuff doesn’t
work, even from Windows. The Hackintosh folks can just find someone with a
working Mac and ask them to download from App Store and make install media, or
find less legitimate sources, they probably don’t care as much. But if my own
system crashes, I’d probably want to get working install media immediately,
myself, and from Apple. Without all this mess.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s
2020, and even though it might look like a good replacement for custom
autocomplete widgets, browser issues made me get rid of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve built a web app to help me track my expenses. The app is written in Django,
and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Kwpolska/django-expenses"&gt;it’s open source&lt;/a&gt;. One of
the goals was to have a simple codebase with limited external JS dependencies,
as well as basic usability with JS disabled. This is partially to facilitate
learning of standard DOM manipulation routines and TypeScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JS/TS bits are called the &lt;em&gt;Scripting Enhancements&lt;/em&gt; to reflect their nature.
The biggest items are an interactive bill editor (a table with add/edit/remove
operations, that submits its data as a regular HTML POST &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;lt;form&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;) and an
autocomplete framework (used by the bill editor in an advanced way, and by
other screens in the app with a more basic featureset). The autocomplete
framework is exactly what you’d expect: point it at an input field and a URL,
and keypresses lead to the URL being queried for previous values for this
field, which are displayed as possible values to the user to save typing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="autocomplete-with-html-5-the-datalist-tag"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Autocomplete with HTML 5: the &amp;lt;datalist&amp;gt; tag&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how to display the options to the user? Most people would display a
&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;position: absolute&lt;/code&gt; box with links/buttons, throw in some more logic around
the focus and blur events, and call it a day. There are tons of ready-made
solutions that do all that for you, although most of them are terrible. But!
HTML 5 introduced a &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;lt;datalist&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag. And it looks like everything you could
need. You link a &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;lt;datalist&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag to an &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;lt;input&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and it shows matching
options in an autocomplete-style box.  In fact, here’s a simple demo, in case
your browser supports it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="card mb-3 text-center"&gt;
    &lt;div class="card-body"&gt;
        &lt;label for="dldemo" class="ml-1 mr-1"&gt;Favorite programming language:&lt;/label&gt;

            &lt;option value="C"&gt;
        &lt;/option&gt;&lt;/datalist&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="card-footer"&gt;&lt;a href="https://chriswarrick.com/listings/datalist/datalist-demo.html.html"&gt;View demo source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, here are a few takeaways from that demo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Options are displayed in the same order as in the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;lt;datalist&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag in the
source, this list was sorted reverse-alphabetically in the source, and
that’s how it appears in the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The list is filtered case-insensitively based on user-input substrings. In
Chrome, Firefox and Safari, the substring can appear at any point in the
string.  But in Edge (old Microsoft engine), it looks only at the beginning
of the string.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some browsers show an arrow on the field to show the entries, sometimes
double-clicking opens the list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entry for C# is as follows: &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;lt;option &lt;span class="pre"&gt;value="C#"&amp;gt;C&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;Sharp&amp;lt;/option&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.
Chrome displays it on as &lt;span class="raw-html"&gt;“&lt;strong&gt;C#&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;small&gt;C
Sharp&lt;/small&gt;”&lt;/span&gt; (on two lines), Safari shows only “C#”, Firefox and Edge
show “C Sharp”. Selecting the option always inputs C#.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mobile Safari does not expand the list by default, but displays some of the
options above the keyboard (as typing predictions). You can click on the
arrow to display all the options in a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/controls/pickers/"&gt;scrolling picker&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chrome on Android displays it the same way as on desktop (drop-down list).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This demo uses static, hardcoded data. Doing that for the Expenses app would
be terrible for performance — that would waste bandwidth, force the browser to
parse a fairly long list, and it could easily overload the browser when it
tries to expand the list. But wiring it up to a &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;fetch()&lt;/code&gt; call to a REST API
should not be hard, and browsers work correctly when the datalist changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="an-emoji-hack"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;An emoji hack&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the features I needed was to make the auto-complete fill out more than
one field at once. Well, &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;lt;datalist&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; has no specific support for that. It only
supports showing a list and putting the value in the input box it’s connected
to. But choosing something from the list fires the usual &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;input&lt;/code&gt; event. I
opted to do this: show every entry with a sparkles emoji (✨) in front, with the
two other fields also inside this string, delimited by other emoji, and then
catch the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;input&lt;/code&gt; event.  If the field beigns with ✨, then use a regex to go
from one emoji-delimited string to three, and place the correct strings in
three input boxes (while also removing the sparkles from the first field).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it’s a hack. But it’s pretty okay appearance-wise, and it does work. It
wouldn’t have worked so well in Edge, but I didn’t even know about this
behavior before writing this blog post, and the initial sparkles emoji could be
dropped and I could still make it work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="works-on-mobile-yes-except"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Works on mobile? Yes, except…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went on and deployed the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;lt;datalist&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;-based autocomplete to my site. It
looked good, worked fine. To use the thing on mobile, I’ve got a special
launcher app. Its main reason for existence? I want a home screen icon, but
Chrome only allows progressive web apps to do that (and that’s busywork I don’t
feel like doing), and back then, Firefox (which has no such restrictions) did
not support &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;lt;datalist&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; on Android.  The app is fairly simple, with a
standard WebView widget and a slide-out navigation drawer, and a few other nice
things, and it’s 120 SLOC of Kotlin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, I bought a new phone, and with it, upgraded from Android 7 to 9. And
I hit a bug in Chrome, which is still not fixed. The bug?
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=949555"&gt;HTML datalist doesn’t work on Android 8 or higher in WebView&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh. We’ve got a bit of a problem. Firefox still didn’t seem to support
&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;lt;datalist&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. But there’s one more way to make an app show a webpage: Custom
Tabs. This is a feature you’ve probably seen around Android, and it’s somewhere
in between. The app gets minimum control over the appearance of the toolbar,
but the “real” web browser is responsible for rendering the page. Chrome in a
Custom Tab supports &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;lt;datalist&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. So I built a small app to do what I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was just one minor thing to fix. My default browser on mobile is &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/focus"&gt;Firefox
Focus&lt;/a&gt;. The main features of
Focus are tracking protection, content blocking, and storing zero
history and cookies (permanent incognito mode with one-click clearing). This is
perfect for clicking random links, especially since I hate Chrome’s insistence
on showing webpages you visited 5 years ago once when autocompleting URLs.
(Chrome is my secondary browser on mobile; on desktop, I almost always have an
incognito window open.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is Focus relevant to this story? One, it (still) does not support the tag.
Two, the default browser is also the provider of the Custom Tabs. Which is
great for my web-browsing habits, but won’t solve the problem.  Fortunately,
it’s just a one-line change to send the intent directly to Chrome. The entire
thing is less than 30 lines long. You can see the full &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://chriswarrick.com/listings/android-chrome-custom-tabs/CustomTabsActivity.java.html"&gt;CustomTabsActivity.java&lt;/a&gt; file, but the relevant bits are below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems to work well, the list is displayed, and it can be used to input
stuff, the emoji hack works too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was one more bug with Chrome on Android. Typing a character sometimes led to
it appearing twice: I typed &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;, the hints appeared, then the text box started
showing &lt;em&gt;AA&lt;/em&gt;, and my hints disappeared. I can’t reproduce it right now, but
that also made the entire flow just annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="aftermath"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Aftermath&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all the browser bugs, support issues, and various glitches, I decided to
build an autocomplete widget of my own. I took the CSS from Bootstrap 4, and
used Popper.js to do the positioning. It looks and works better, has keyboard
support, and is definitely less hacky (the emoji is still there, because they
look good, but my entries know the original object they were made from and can
just tell the handler to use that instead of using regex). And it beats many of
the autocomplete widgets out there, because they often fail when you hold the
mouse a bit longer; also, it can reposition itself to the top if there’s more
space. All that in just 198 SLOC of TypeScript. (I also discovered a bug in my
code that made it work a bit worse, fixing it for the old implementation would
still not fix the other issues.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s the moral of the story? Even though HTML 5 has been a standard for many
years, browser support for the new tags still seems to be an issue. And
sometimes, it’s better to just put in the extra work and build a good UI on
your own, instead of trusting the browser to do it right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same applies to other “new” HTML 5 form elements.  &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;lt;input &lt;span class="pre"&gt;type="date"&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
is not supported in desktop Safari, and is fairly ugly in desktop Firefox and
Chrome.  It displays the standard OS picker on mobile, which gets you a
calendar on Android, but a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/controls/pickers/"&gt;scrolling picker&lt;/a&gt; on iOS.
&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;datetime-local&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is currently Chrome-only.  &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;month&lt;/code&gt; lets you click on a day
and end up with an entire month selected in Chrome.  A custom component with
JavaScript would be far more consistent and often easier to use.&lt;/p&gt;

An attempt to customize the Bootstrap CSS theme requires 50 MB of node_modules, over 500 packages, and comes with a bit of frustration at stupid tools and terrible documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might notice that this website is based on Bootstrap. You might also notice it’s been heavily customized, especially if you’re browsing in the (currently default) Dark Mode. Back in Bootstrap v3 days, the task was accomplished by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/customize/"&gt;a simple online tool&lt;/a&gt; that required no local installs. Bootstrap 4 changed the landscape: now you need to manually compile Sass. Moreover, Autoprefixer is required to make the CSS usable by web browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, when it comes to web development, I believe the old ways were better. Back when nobody thought to make a client-side-JS-based blog or pastebin, and only apps that needed interactivity were JS-first. Gmail is a good example of that, although they &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; offer a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/15049?hl=en"&gt;basic HTML view&lt;/a&gt; and it works good — in fact, I suppose it might be less buggy than the JS-ladden version. (A lot of single-page apps like to randomly glitch out in my experience.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still remember the days when all that one had to do is &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;java &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-jar&lt;/span&gt; yuicompressor.jar style.css &amp;gt; style.min.css&lt;/code&gt;. Then Less and Sass became more popular — and that’s good. The ability to use variables and functions makes it possible to produce well-organized stylesheets. The idea of Autoprefixer is also fine, humans should not waste their time with browser-specific prefixes for experimental features, that can be neatly automated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to use all these fancy tools, glue code is necessary. Autoprefixer is (mainly server-side) JS-only, Sass is currently Node or Dart, minifier tools are available in many languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="attempt-0-no-js-stuff-no-node-modules"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Attempt 0: no JS stuff, no node_modules&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I installed a Sass compiler. There are web services like cssminifier.com that can be easily used with curl in a Bash script. Autoprefixer has a webpage that lets you use the service without installing it as well. The catch is, the code runs locally in your web browser. Automating a web browser requires some effort. I decided to leave this part un-automated. Here is the Bash script I hacked together (with some messages removed):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “manual copy” solution was inconvenient, but it worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, most of the time Some lags/glitches with the clipboard meant that sometimes, files had the incorrect content. So, I wanted to fix it, and build it in a more modern, JS-y way. The way Bootstrap does it is a lot of shell commands (that run various Node tools). I don’t feel like building this pipeline with Bash, it would feel fragile. Let’s do it the JS way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="attempt-1-webpack"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Attempt 1: webpack&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve used webpack for &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Kwpolska/django-expenses/blob/master/ts/webpack.config.js"&gt;another project of mine&lt;/a&gt;. It was okay, and it did the job (namely, compiling TypeScript into browser-usable JS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to give it a try for this one. I googled “webpack sass”. The first result was &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader"&gt;sass-loader&lt;/a&gt;. The pipeline for it was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre class="code javascript"&gt;&lt;a id="rest_code_af9c4ca338ae42f0a5f1c74ac9dba806-1" name="rest_code_af9c4ca338ae42f0a5f1c74ac9dba806-1" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2019/02/15/modern-web-development-where-you-need-500-packages-to-build-bootstrap/#rest_code_af9c4ca338ae42f0a5f1c74ac9dba806-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"style-loader"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// creates style nodes from JS strings&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a id="rest_code_af9c4ca338ae42f0a5f1c74ac9dba806-2" name="rest_code_af9c4ca338ae42f0a5f1c74ac9dba806-2" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2019/02/15/modern-web-development-where-you-need-500-packages-to-build-bootstrap/#rest_code_af9c4ca338ae42f0a5f1c74ac9dba806-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"css-loader"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// translates CSS into CommonJS&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a id="rest_code_af9c4ca338ae42f0a5f1c74ac9dba806-3" name="rest_code_af9c4ca338ae42f0a5f1c74ac9dba806-3" href="https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2019/02/15/modern-web-development-where-you-need-500-packages-to-build-bootstrap/#rest_code_af9c4ca338ae42f0a5f1c74ac9dba806-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;"sass-loader"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// compiles Sass to CSS, using Node Sass by default&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s recap. Someone thought that the right way to do CSS is to use JS imports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;import &lt;span class="pre"&gt;"./style.css";&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; in a JS file. So that your fancy build tool knows about CSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Webpack wasn’t the right tool for my project, but even if I had JS code there, &lt;strong&gt;WHY WOULD I MENTION STYLESHEETS IN MY JS CODE?!&lt;/strong&gt; Webpack’s website also lists .jpg and .png assets, are they meant to be imported in JS as well? This is absurd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going back to googling “webpack sass”… The next two results were Medium posts. The stupidity of Medium as a blog platform notwithstanding, one of the posts was from 2017, referring to webpack 2. The next post was a year older, a completely unreadable mess, and it was for webpack 4. That’s not helpful in any way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="attempt-2-gulp"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Attempt 2: Gulp&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s try something else from the JS world: Gulp. Now, the tool is not terrible, but it still requires a lot of dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pipeline that was required for this task sounds very simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;bootstrap-kw{,-dark}.sass → Sass compiler → Autoprefixer → bootstrap{,-dark}.css → minify → bootstrap{,-dark}.min.css&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gulp version is fairly simple: (I based it on examples on Gulp’s website, and pages of all my dependencies).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section id="a-node-modules-extravaganza"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A node_modules extravaganza&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you see all the &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;require&lt;/code&gt; lines at the top? Every one of them is a dependency of my build script. With the exception of &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;gulp-rename&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, which IMO should be a built-in part of Gulp (it’s 45 lines of code and no external dependencies), the list is sensible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I already mentioned the size of &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt;: 51 MiB according to &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;du&lt;/code&gt; (size-on-disk measurement). How many packages are there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="545"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five hundred and forty-five packages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoa, when did that happen? Most of it comes from gulp/gulp-cli (384 packages), with node-sass taking the second place (177 packages). Some of those are shared between libraries, and a few more belong to the other requirements. And many of these dependencies are a disgrace to programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a full install of my &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;, npm says &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;added 545 packages from 331 contributors and audited 10500 packages in 22.458s&lt;/code&gt;.  I’ve implicitly agreed to licenses imposed by 331 random people. All to build some simple CSS files out of SASS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s go on a tour of &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; and see what we ended up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;section id="polyfills-reimplementations-oh-my"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Polyfills, reimplementations, oh my!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything I’ve installed is meant to be used on top of Node.js. Node runs on top of the V8 engine, coming from Chrome. They’ve had almost-full ES2015 (ES6) support since April 2016. And yet, my node_modules is full of small polyfills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s pick a random one and work back from it: &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;number-is-nan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a one-liner that re-implements &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;Number.isNaN&lt;/code&gt; if it’s not available, which is, according to MDN, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/isNaN"&gt;a more robust version of the original, global
isNaN()&lt;/a&gt;. The original function coerced everything to Number before testing, which apparently wasn’t enough. That’s what you get for using a language designed in a week. The function was added to all sane browsers and Node around 2013, the polyfill was created in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was pulled in by &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;is-fullwidth-code-point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;is-finite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, both by the same author. The latter one is especially interesting: it’s at version 1.0.2. Version 1.0.1improved the codebase from &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;if (x) { return false; } return true&lt;/code&gt; (via pull request), and version 1.0.2 replaced a manual &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;val !== val&lt;/code&gt; comparison with &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;number-is-nan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;number-is-nan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; has 7.5 million weekly downloads, &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;is-finite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; has 6.7M.

&lt;h3&gt;Fifty shades of terminal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every Node-based CLI tool wants to be cool. And for that, they need colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does this work in Bash? You could use &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;tput setaf XX&lt;/code&gt;, but many people would just manually &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;echo '\033[XXm'&lt;/code&gt;, the codes are available &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#3/4_bit"&gt;in Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; or elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does this work in Python? There are a few libraries for this (and you can always do it manually), but the most popular one is &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/colorama/"&gt;colorama&lt;/a&gt;. That library can even handle Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is available in Node?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;color-support&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;supports-color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; are both part of my &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There seems to be a fairly advanced &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;chalk&lt;/code&gt; library, by the aforementioned Sindre Sorhus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;ansi-colors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; seems to be another, smaller option for it, it claims to be 10-20x faster than &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;chalk&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a package called &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;has-ansi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; which checks if a string has ANSI escapes in it. It depends on &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;ansi-regex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;strip-ansi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; also uses &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;ansi-regex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. All three packages are basically one liners. One exports a regex, the other two do replacement/search with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;wrap-ansi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;ansi-wrap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;wrap-ansi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; intelligently wraps a string with ANSI escapes in it.  &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;ansi-wrap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; takes three strings and  returns &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;'\u001b['+&lt;/span&gt; a + 'm' + msg + '\u001b[' + b + 'm'&lt;/code&gt; (Copyright © Jon Schlinkert, MIT license)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s also &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;ansi-gray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, which calls &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;ansi-wrap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; with a = 90, b = 39, and a user-specified message. (Copyright © Jon Schlinkert, MIT license)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;ansi-red&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;ansi-cyan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; are very similar libraries to &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;ansi-gray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Is this a joke?!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are definitely other &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;ansi-$color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; libraries, although they are not in my &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt;. And probably other libraries for color support, but either they are not installed, or I haven’t managed to spot them in my &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;npm list&lt;/code&gt; output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Copyrighted one-liners&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another famous library by Jon Schlinkert is called &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;is-even&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Here is the complete code, verbatim:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;is-number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is another fun library; it says &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; for strings of numbers, and &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; for NaN (&lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;typeof NaN === 'number'&lt;/code&gt;). &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;is-even&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is used by, for example, &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;even&lt;/code&gt;, which calls &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;Array.filter&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;is-even&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; as the argument. There’s also &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;odd&lt;/code&gt;, and for some reason, the two packages are separate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The checks found in &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;is-odd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; make some more sense if you’re working with a dynamically-typed language where every number is a float (like JS). But you could release &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;check-odd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, which is 100x faster than &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;is-odd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (it assumes its input is correct), and exports &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;function checkOdd(value) { return (value % 2) !== 0; }&lt;/code&gt; &lt;s&gt;(Copyright © 2019, Chris Warrick.

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This clause was removed by UC Berkeley in 1999, but there is still old code that has clauses (with other names), and someone could create something with the old license. I actually found one such clause in my &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; (from &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;bcrypt_pbkdf&lt;/code&gt;). &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/bsd.html"&gt;NetBSD had 75 different clauses&lt;/a&gt; in 1997. It would be fun to see figures for the Node ecosystem… or more packages with equally problematic clauses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people aren’t aware of the licenses of their node dependencies. Going back to Colorama, I can quickly verify that Colorama has no dependencies, and itself uses the 3-clause BSD license. (That version of the license lacks the advertising clause and is considered GPL-compatible.) There is a helpful &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;license-checker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; package that can tell you what licenses you have (based on the details provided in &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;package.json&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Attempt 2: back to Bash&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to get rid of Gulp, it’s not necessary for this pipeline. I replaced
it with Bash and &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;postcss-cli&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;node-sass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; was replaced by &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;dart-sass&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
(a two-file binary distribution), and &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;csso&lt;/code&gt; was replaced by &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;cssnano&lt;/code&gt; (it
works with postcss). Here is the resulting Bash file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bash script now pipes &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;sass&lt;/code&gt; output to &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;node run_postcss.js &lt;span class="pre"&gt;bootstrap(-dark)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing this… cost me a new dependency. Its name is &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;get-stdin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. We’ve already met its author, Sindre Sorhus. While the library has its deficiencies &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/get-stdin/issues/21"&gt;(namely, it doesn’t support reading from TTY)&lt;/a&gt;, it’s good enough. I could do it manually or use some other tricks, but since &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;get-stdin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; does not pull in any other dependencies, I’m going to accept it. After cleaning up &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;packages.json&lt;/code&gt;, we end up with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The task at hand was very simple. So was the JS code (Gulp and custom) I had to write to implement it. But underneath, there was a mess of unknown, unaudited code, duplicated libraries, and libraries created effectively to bump people’s npm download stats. There were already incidents, like &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;left-pad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (the removal of which broke Babel), or &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;event-stream&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (which was taken over and modified to steal cryptocurrencies). The modern web development ecosystem is a huge mess of dependencies and one-line packages. Some of them are necessary due to the lackluster JS standard library — but some are just useless. And some of these micro-packages would be better off as larger libraries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, the package count went down from the original 545 to 144. But the original point still stands: too much useless stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PS. Five of the packages (in the “large” set) had a &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;.DS_Store&lt;/code&gt; file left over. I’m wondering if there are any other files that shouldn’t be shipped with packages, lurking in &lt;code class="docutils literal"&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; directories all over the world…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PPS. I’ve replaced Disqus with Isso, because it had too many advertisements. If you experience any issues with the comment system (after force-refreshing), e-mail me.&lt;/p&gt;
