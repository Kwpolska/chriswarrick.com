Facebook just scared me with some data points
it has about me.  Full story, right after the break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s &lt;em&gt;abundance of knowledge&lt;/em&gt; as presented by Facebook comes from Facebook’s
&lt;em&gt;stranger familiarization&lt;/em&gt; feature.  Fancy made-up words aside, it’s the
notifications of the form:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Jaime Lannister &lt;strong&gt;(friends with Cersei Lannister)&lt;/strong&gt; liked your photo.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I hadn’t gotten to see these sort of notices too often.  The first time I
encountered those, Facebook chose some &lt;strong&gt;bad&lt;/strong&gt; examples.  A human, given my
friends list — complete with some basic data and descriptions — could have
easily devised a better one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that was long ago.  Facebook’s knowledge of me has improved &lt;em&gt;vastly&lt;/em&gt;.  You
should see my face back when I received another notification lately.  Facebook
chose a mutual friend out of ten possibilities.  And boy, had they nailed it.
Now, with my memory of the previous occurrence, I thought it was a good guess.
A guess, as I I believed it was just good ol’ &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;/dev/urandom&lt;/tt&gt; supplemented by
the 10% probability resulting in this serendipitous output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this happened yet again yesterday.  Two distinct people, one identical
suggestion.  A perfect one at that.  This would be too good.  The probability
was kinda lower this time.  And yet, it came up with a perfect choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How this happened is beyond me.  It looks like this is &lt;strong&gt;not random&lt;/strong&gt;.  It’s an
algorithm.  Facebook probably has some sort of lookup table, matching my
friends with some fancy &lt;em&gt;likability&lt;/em&gt; coefficient — probably calculated from
chat history, or likes, or the vast archives Facebook has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d love to see what Facebook thinks about me.  I might even contribute better
numbers, as they &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be wrong — then again, I have absolutely no idea what
they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone from Facebook is listening: I’d love to see the data you use for this
algorithm — and possibly many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="bonus-downloading-my-data"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bonus: downloading my data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually requested my Facebook data archive right now.  One of the
information included was &lt;em&gt;Mobile Network Connection Quality&lt;/em&gt;.  It shows the
average bandwidth and round-trip time of my HSPA+ mobile networks and Wi-Fi
networks (collectively).  Here’s a question: &lt;strong&gt;WHY&lt;/strong&gt; does Facebook care?!  What is
the purpose of collecting this information?  They can’t do anything about it,
unless they were to send complaints to the service providers.  Which they
cannot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digging through the archive even further, Facebook seems to fail with ads (that
I don’t see anyways…)  How can I fix it?  The tags are completely wrong and not
valid for yours truly…  They should at least &lt;strong&gt;try&lt;/strong&gt; to show me valid
advertisements.  Here is a sample of what was chosen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#Censorship.&lt;/strong&gt;  Not really.  I don’t have anything to do with censorship at
all.  It actually comes from a page I liked, that doesn’t really do any
anti-censorship activism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#[my city here].&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;#[a video game].&lt;/strong&gt;  Both make sense.  I actually
liked pages related to both.  (Though I liked the second game of the series
and the tag is for the first, or — at worst — all games collectively.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#[a movie I HAVE NEVER SEEN]&lt;/strong&gt;.  Facebook failed at getting the reference
yet again.  The title of the movie appears in the name of a page — but they
are not related at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#[a South Hemisphere company I never heard of.]&lt;/strong&gt;  I actually see the
reference after looking at my likes and their Wikipedia page.  It’s &lt;strong&gt;very invalid&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;…and many more incorrect things I do not care about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would have thought Facebook has developed algorithms to devise correct
&lt;strong&gt;ads&lt;/strong&gt; — the thing their money comes from…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still do not understand all this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2014/11/07/facebook-knows-too-much/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2014 19:20:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Managing Tasks, Chris’ Way</title><link>https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2013/11/16/managing-tasks/</link><dc:creator>Chris Warrick</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management"&gt;Time management&lt;/a&gt; is hard.
The best way to do it is to have a task list, also known as a &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#Implementation_of_goals"&gt;to-do list&lt;/a&gt;.
And the best tool?  Pen and paper.  Yes, analog pen and analog paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it should not be your regular analog piece of paper.  What I do
instead is printing out a nice template.  A template crafted in
LaTeX, which is the best typesetting system for technical stuff
and technical people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of the project is to make a human-friendly, usable todo-list
templates to be used.  The templates can also be filled in by
LaTeX itself, if you want and feel like installing a
LaTeX compiler (XeLaTeX to be precise) — for all the other
people, an empty template is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="get-it"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Get it!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Kwpolska/todolist"&gt;the project and source code on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Kwpolska/todolist/releases"&gt;the releases page on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; — contains an empty
template (&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Empty.pdf&lt;/tt&gt;) and a file with sample data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="licensing"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Licensing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;.tex&lt;/tt&gt; files are licensed under a 3-clause BSD license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;.pdf&lt;/tt&gt; files are licensed under a &lt;strong&gt;custom&lt;/strong&gt; license based ont he
3-clause BSD license.&lt;/p&gt;
