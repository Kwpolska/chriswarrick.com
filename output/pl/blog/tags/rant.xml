&lt;p class="caption"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;About Windows&lt;/em&gt; screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I upgraded Windows 10 from the RTM version (build 10240, July 2015) to the
&lt;em&gt;November Upgrade&lt;/em&gt; version (1511/build 10560). It took me a good two hours,
multiple reboots, and a BSOD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I upgraded to Windows 10 (from Windows 10) back in August. The upgrade
experience was okay. The main issue I had was that the error messages were a
bit uninformative. There was one error, Windows 10 claimed it &lt;em&gt;couldn’t check
available disk space&lt;/em&gt;, which is a really strange way to say &lt;em&gt;your active
partition is a Linux one and you have a Linux bootloader set up&lt;/em&gt;. But after
switching to the Windows bootloader, it worked fine. I only had to fight a bit
with the display drivers, but other than that, it succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows 10 claims to be &lt;em&gt;Windows as a Service&lt;/em&gt;: a fast update cycle with
new Windows builds released often. Now, Linux users are accustomed to this.
Depending on your distribution, you get new versions somewhere between “every
day” (rolling release: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://chriswarrick.com/blog/2011/01/06/arch-linux-the-best-distro-ever/"&gt;Arch Linux&lt;/a&gt;,
Gentoo, Debian sid), “every 6 months” (Ubuntu, Fedora), or some other time
scale.
(Three months and two weeks passed between the two “general” builds of Windows 10.)
And most of the time, the upgrades are fast and relatively painless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Windows 10, this is not the case. I booted to Windows yesterday, to set up
some new hardware and mess around with the OS. It offered the upgrade in
Windows Update. After downloading it (3 GB, according to Microsoft), it started
installing, without success. There were no error messages, and “Error” or
“Failed to install” were all I could get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the setup log files. The error log ended with “failed to
resurrect new system”. Which didn’t make a lot of sense to me, even though I’m
quite proficient with this sort of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be dangerous, so I backed up my drives with Clonezilla, which is
really useful — and it ships with the Arch Linux ISO, which helped a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I tried my trusty friend, the Media Creation Tool. I needed it to get the
original install to work, and it came useful now. After yet another download,
I got a USB stick with Windows 10 on it. So, I rebooted to the installer, which
told me I can’t use it and I need to start it from within Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I rebooted back into Windows, started the installer. It took it a while to
begin the installation process (including waiting forever to get updates,
so I restarted the process and disabled updating now, and another long wait to
make sure it will work on my machine), but then it went quite fast and was at 70%
after less than 10 minutes. Sadly, that’s too good to be true. It rebooted and
started counting from zero. 90 minutes passed since I started, and the login
screen came up. Username, password, log in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hi, we’ve updated your PC.&lt;/em&gt; Six more minutes, but at long last, I got my
desktop. There’s just one problem though: 1024×768 is not the screen resolution
I started the install with (oddly enough, the “Updating Windows” part was
running at 1080p for part of the process, and then went back to 768p after a
reboot). I tried installing NVIDIA drivers, and it failed — however, Windows
managed to install something and wanted a reboot (what is this, Windows 95?).
Fine, let’s reboot and get a fully functional Windows environment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;:( &lt;em&gt;Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart.&lt;/em&gt; A blue screen of death,
on the second boot, talking about &lt;em&gt;critical structure corruption in CI.dll&lt;/em&gt;. Well, shit.
I rebooted, but I first took a little detour to the Arch Linux USB stick I
prepared before to get a sane bootloader back. I’ve done this before, and
usually requires three commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code console"&gt;&lt;a name="rest_code_50e764ec822c487e80ba0b8b79c99213-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="gp"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; mount /dev/sda2 /mnt
&lt;a name="rest_code_50e764ec822c487e80ba0b8b79c99213-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="go"&gt;Metadata kept in Windows cache, refused to mount.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name="rest_code_50e764ec822c487e80ba0b8b79c99213-3"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="go"&gt;Failed to mount '/dev/sda2': Operation not permitted&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name="rest_code_50e764ec822c487e80ba0b8b79c99213-4"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="go"&gt;The NTFS partition is in an unsafe state. Please resume and shutdown&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name="rest_code_50e764ec822c487e80ba0b8b79c99213-5"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="go"&gt;Windows fully (no hibernation or fast restarting), or mount the volume&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name="rest_code_50e764ec822c487e80ba0b8b79c99213-6"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="go"&gt;read-only with the 'ro' mount option.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wait, what?! I remember my hard drive layout, and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;/dev/sda2&lt;/tt&gt; is my Linux
ext4 partition! I checked &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;cfdisk&lt;/tt&gt;, and apparently I now have a &lt;em&gt;Hidden NTFS WinRE&lt;/em&gt;, with Linux moved to &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;/dev/sda3&lt;/tt&gt; and my extended partition moved to &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;/dev/sda4&lt;/tt&gt; (what would happen if I already had four partitions?). This is typical Windows misbehaviour: &lt;strong&gt;not caring about other OSes that might be installed&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I accepted this defeat, mounted &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;/dev/sda3&lt;/tt&gt;, ran &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;arch-chroot&lt;/span&gt; /mnt&lt;/tt&gt; and
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;syslinux-install_update&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; (I’m not a fan of GRUB 2, and I have a MBR
drive layout). I should test this out by rebooting into Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code console"&gt;&lt;a name="rest_code_4e4cd6991afd45d384870c64f7de79c9-1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="go"&gt;Error getting authority: Error initializing authority: Could not connect: No such file or directory (g-io-error-quark, 1)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;a name="rest_code_4e4cd6991afd45d384870c64f7de79c9-2"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class="go"&gt;Welcome to emergency mode!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;systemd &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; values &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;/etc/fstab&lt;/tt&gt;, and you can’t boot if any entry fails
to mount, which was the case with the Windows drive in &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;/dev/sda1&lt;/tt&gt; and my
other NTFS partition (note that the error message is very unhelpful)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I have to get into Windows first. I tried booting Windows again, this
time it worked (in glorious 1080p, which was the case on the previous boot
too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Windows re-enabled Fast Boot (a.k.a. hibernation instead of clean shutdown)
as part of the upgrade. I hunted down the setting and restored sanity.
But when I was doing that, I noticed things were spelt (or spelled) a bit
differently than two hours ago. You see, the original Windows 7 system was US
English. After the upgrade to Windows 10, I took the opportunity to install the
British and Polish language packs (it’s a multi-user machine). Both of which
were gone. I had to fix that, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And all I got out of it were colourful window borders, which are not even in my
desired colour (Windows has a limited colour palette, even though I explicitly
set it to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://chriswarrick.com/brand/"&gt;#00AADD&lt;/a&gt;). What a great way to waste a Saturday!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leaves me wondering, how does this work for Windows Insiders (Microsoft’s
community beta testers)? Is the process better if Windows Update manages to
perform the install? Or is it substantially faster if you’re running on a SSD?
Perhaps the testers have dedicated machines and don’t run experimental builds
on their daily drivers. But I doubt that, because that’s a significant
investment without any financial gain from helping out a corporation. So,
virtual machines? I have no idea how they cope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;cmd.exe&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;winver.exe&lt;/tt&gt; claims it’s &lt;em&gt;Copyright © 2016&lt;/em&gt;. Previously, Windows copyright
notices were outdated. Now, they’re in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2015/12/27/windows-10-november-upgrade-windows-as-a-dis-service/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 27 Dec 2015 11:15:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Facebook Knows Too Much.</title><link>https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2014/11/07/facebook-knows-too-much/</link><dc:creator>Chris Warrick</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post is stating the obvious.  Facebook just scared me with some data points
it has about me.  Full story, right after the break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today’s &lt;em&gt;abundance of knowledge&lt;/em&gt; as presented by Facebook comes from Facebook’s
&lt;em&gt;stranger familiarization&lt;/em&gt; feature.  Fancy made-up words aside, it’s the
notifications of the form:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Jaime Lannister &lt;strong&gt;(friends with Cersei Lannister)&lt;/strong&gt; liked your photo.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I hadn’t gotten to see these sort of notices too often.  The first time I
encountered those, Facebook chose some &lt;strong&gt;bad&lt;/strong&gt; examples.  A human, given my
friends list — complete with some basic data and descriptions — could have
easily devised a better one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that was long ago.  Facebook’s knowledge of me has improved &lt;em&gt;vastly&lt;/em&gt;.  You
should see my face back when I received another notification lately.  Facebook
chose a mutual friend out of ten possibilities.  And boy, had they nailed it.
Now, with my memory of the previous occurrence, I thought it was a good guess.
A guess, as I I believed it was just good ol’ &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;/dev/urandom&lt;/tt&gt; supplemented by
the 10% probability resulting in this serendipitous output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this happened yet again yesterday.  Two distinct people, one identical
suggestion.  A perfect one at that.  This would be too good.  The probability
was kinda lower this time.  And yet, it came up with a perfect choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How this happened is beyond me.  It looks like this is &lt;strong&gt;not random&lt;/strong&gt;.  It’s an
algorithm.  Facebook probably has some sort of lookup table, matching my
friends with some fancy &lt;em&gt;likability&lt;/em&gt; coefficient — probably calculated from
chat history, or likes, or the vast archives Facebook has.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d love to see what Facebook thinks about me.  I might even contribute better
numbers, as they &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be wrong — then again, I have absolutely no idea what
they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone from Facebook is listening: I’d love to see the data you use for this
algorithm — and possibly many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="bonus-downloading-my-data"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bonus: downloading my data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually requested my Facebook data archive right now.  One of the
information included was &lt;em&gt;Mobile Network Connection Quality&lt;/em&gt;.  It shows the
average bandwidth and round-trip time of my HSPA+ mobile networks and Wi-Fi
networks (collectively).  Here’s a question: &lt;strong&gt;WHY&lt;/strong&gt; does Facebook care?!  What is
the purpose of collecting this information?  They can’t do anything about it,
unless they were to send complaints to the service providers.  Which they
cannot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digging through the archive even further, Facebook seems to fail with ads (that
I don’t see anyways…)  How can I fix it?  The tags are completely wrong and not
valid for yours truly…  They should at least &lt;strong&gt;try&lt;/strong&gt; to show me valid
advertisements.  Here is a sample of what was chosen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#Censorship.&lt;/strong&gt;  Not really.  I don’t have anything to do with censorship at
all.  It actually comes from a page I liked, that doesn’t really do any
anti-censorship activism.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#[my city here].&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;strong&gt;#[a video game].&lt;/strong&gt;  Both make sense.  I actually
liked pages related to both.  (Though I liked the second game of the series
and the tag is for the first, or — at worst — all games collectively.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#[a movie I HAVE NEVER SEEN]&lt;/strong&gt;.  Facebook failed at getting the reference
yet again.  The title of the movie appears in the name of a page — but they
are not related at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#[a South Hemisphere company I never heard of.]&lt;/strong&gt;  I actually see the
reference after looking at my likes and their Wikipedia page.  It’s &lt;strong&gt;very invalid&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;…and many more incorrect things I do not care about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would have thought Facebook has developed algorithms to devise correct
&lt;strong&gt;ads&lt;/strong&gt; — the thing their money comes from…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still do not understand all this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2014/11/07/facebook-knows-too-much/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 07 Nov 2014 19:20:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Password Changing 101</title><link>https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2013/02/09/password-changing-101/</link><dc:creator>Chris Warrick</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I finally created a new password for myself.  Now, changing
passwords all over the world is what I should do.  But it isn’t easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One important thing: the new password is &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://xkcd.com/936/"&gt;XKCD 936&lt;/a&gt; compatible.  It makes no
sense at all and is &lt;strong&gt;32&lt;/strong&gt; characters (29 letters) long.  I kept myself within
ASCII, specifically 0x20 + 0x61…0x7A.  The previous password was &lt;strong&gt;9&lt;/strong&gt;
characters long and a few (4 or 5) years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="the-great-list-of-password-changes"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Great List of Password Changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After updating the most important passwords (Linux, Google, Twitter, Facebook,
GitHub, Reddit, Remember the Milk, Trello), I took an analog piece of paper and
wrote down all the places where I should change my password.  I wrote down
&lt;strong&gt;26&lt;/strong&gt; different places.  We will go through them (including the above ones,
save for Linux.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="password-update-wall-of-fame"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Password Update Wall of Fame&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In alphabetical order,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arch User Repository&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Codecademy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dropbox*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GitHub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Heroku&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IFTTT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Khan Academy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MediaWiki (Wikipedia etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reddit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remember the Milk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twitter*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of those make it easy to change your password.  Just go to the profile
page, find the appropriate fields, fill them (sometimes your previous password
is needed, sometimes it isn’t, that’s generally fine) and kaboom, your password
is changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Services marked with an asterisk sent me an e-mail confirmation, which is even
better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="password-update-wall-of-amnesia"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Password Update Wall of Amnesia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to simulate amnesia for those services.  I couldn’t find a Password reset
functionality or it was broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;DISQUS&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;DISQUS has a nice password update link.  One problem, it doesn’t work.
After simulating amnesia, all is well.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;TweetDeck&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Couldn’t find a valid option for what I needed, so I simulated amnesia and
it worked just fine.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Mailman&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Some passwords were my previous password, others were my unsafe passwords,
others weren’t my password at all.  All were changed to the unsafe
passwords, sometimes with a need to simulate amnesia.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="password-update-wall-of-bullshit"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Password Update Wall of BULLSHIT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those services are SHIT in terms of password reset!  I have absolutely no idea
why I have an account with them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;AOL/AIM&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;It wanted a CAPTCHA, link click and other magic.  Moreover, passwords are
limited to 16 characters.  Enough to type half of my password, at least,
but this is still bad!  The proper upper limit is NONE.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Gadu-Gadu&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;A Polish IM.  It required amnesia, a difficult CAPTCHA, and when I typed my
password, it rejected it without any meaningful error messages (an
exclamation mark isn’t considered a valid error message.)&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Microsoft&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Sixteen characters, no spaces, requires fancy characters.  I did not change
my password, because it won’t let me.  Oh, and aren’t those passwords used
for Windows 8, making it even less secure, considering that &lt;cite&gt;passwords are
saved using a reversible encryption method if you use the fancy new
authentication methods (PIN/Picture Password) &amp;lt;http://arstechnica.com/security/2012/10/experts-windows-8-features-make-account-passwords-easier-to-steal/&amp;gt;&lt;/cite&gt;!&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;PayPal&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;I trust them with my money, but they believe that my password is weak (1/3)
and have a 20 character limit.  I took the half and added a &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;!&lt;/tt&gt; so they
would let me use it.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Steam&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;You need to do it from within the desktop app.  Which crashes for me under
Linux due to a recent update.  And I need to do important work under Linux.
So the password will get updated when I will get (a) to Windows; (b) Steam
for Linux working.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="how-to-do-a-proper-password-update-process-for-web-devs"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to do a proper password update process (for web devs)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;User logged in&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Profile/settings page should contain a field for the current password (for
added security) and two fields for the new password and its confirmation.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;User forgot their password&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Ask for an e-mail or the username.  Then, do an e-mail confirmation and let
the user set his password.  Ask twice for the new password.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Limits, requirements etc.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Lower limit of 8 characters should be good enough for most people, and
upper limit should not exist.  A password meter like &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://tech.dropbox.com/2012/04/zxcvbn-realistic-password-strength-estimation/"&gt;zxcvbn by Dropbox&lt;/a&gt;
would also be a great idea.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2013/02/09/password-changing-101/</guid><pubDate>Sat, 09 Feb 2013 12:26:04 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Forty Million is Nothing!</title><link>https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2012/12/02/forty-million-is-nothing/</link><dc:creator>Chris Warrick</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been busy, but I now have time to write about it: in a bit over one month,
Microsoft sold &lt;strong&gt;40,000,000&lt;/strong&gt; licenses of Microsoft Windows.  That is a little
bit above, hmm, nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blogs.windows.com/windows/b/bloggingwindows/archive/2012/11/27/windows-8-40-million-licenses-sold.aspx"&gt;Obligatory Microsoft link&lt;/a&gt;.  But, oh wait, there is one important word:
&lt;em&gt;licenses&lt;/em&gt;.  So, when [insert favorite OEM here] called Microsoft and said he
wants eg. 10000 OEM licenses for his new PCs.  The counter goes up by 10000 the
moment &lt;em&gt;Microsoft&lt;/em&gt; gets their money for the license, and not when the OEM gets
their money for a sold machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have sorted out the OEM thing.  But how does this number relate to
BOX/Upgrade purchases?  Activations or shipments?  That is also important.  And
that is how you go from 10 million to 40 million. without actually selling that
many copies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now, let’s talk a bit about the NPD.  And I mean the US market reasearcher
and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/press-releases/windows-8-gets-off-to-a-slow-start-according-to-the-npd-group/"&gt;what they wrote about Windows 8&lt;/a&gt;. What did they write, may you ask?  8
(and PCs themselves) did not do well.  Great news for sane people!
Unfortunately, it was just one month.  Including Black Friday, though.  And I
hope Windows 8 will die horribly.  And quickly.  Same goes for Microsoft.
Because people do not want Modern UI (aka Metro).  And Windows tablets.  Now go
buy an iPad.  Or a Mac.  Or both.  Or a Windows 7 PC.  Or a clean PC on which
you can install Linux, and preferrably a good distro of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2012/12/02/forty-million-is-nothing/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 02 Dec 2012 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Sinofsky out</title><link>https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2012/11/14/sinofsky-out/</link><dc:creator>Chris Warrick</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steven Sinofsky said goodbye to Microsoft on &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://allthingsd.com/20121112/breaking-windows-head-steven-sinofsky-to-leave-microsoft/"&gt;Monday&lt;/a&gt;.  Who is he,
may you ask?  The guy that provided us with entertainment for the last
few months here.  He was responsible for creating this beautiful piece
of shit that is Windows 8.  So, he fucked shit up and quit.
Marvellous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, bye Steve, and have fun fucking shit up somewhere else.  Maybe
Scheißung, um, Samsung?&lt;/p&gt;

That is, 16 days ago.  Why am I writing
about it now?  Easy: because I did not even bother doing a review.  This is
just a bit of quick commentary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used Windows 8 for a bit since the RTM, thanks to the 90-day evaluation.
And?  Not too much has changed since Release Preview.  It lost even more Aero.
Other little changes appeared.  That’s it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tested the new system on some humans.  They didn’t quite like and understand
the new stuff.  So, not good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And also, there are TV ads and other marketing materials.  Can you please guess
what is used to control the system in them?  That’s right: touch.  They also
recommend new PCs.  Most of them are the ones I like to call “hipster”:
ultrabooks, all-in-ones, tablets, convertibles.  Oh well.  Because everybody
wants to buy a brand new PC now.  Tell you what: most people don’t.  Unlike eg.
smartphones, people generally buy new PCs when their old ones are (a) broken;
(b) painfully slow; (c) old as hell.  So we have that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That $40 upgrades are a way to get more people to use Windows 8.  They did it,
because they know that they might not get a lot of upgrades if it was more
expensive.  Another possible explanation is the fact that it may not be liked
by people.  The cheaper the product, the more likely are people to buy it
impulsively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That concludes my thoughts for now.  I will publish more of them when sales
reports will be published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="bonus-get-to-know-windows"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Bonus: &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/basics"&gt;Get to know Windows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click on the section title.  Go ahead.  I suggest a {Ctrl,Cmd}-click.  It goes
over to Microsoft.com.  Now, why you need to go to Microsoft.com to learn this?
Why isn’t this shown at the first login to Windows?  Or at least a “Hello, you
may want to learn what we will fuck you with for the next three or so years
unless you decide to downgrade, but we all know that you won’t, right?
Right?  &lt;strong&gt;Learn more&lt;/strong&gt; pop-up.  So, &lt;em&gt;Overview&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Search, share, &amp;amp;
more&lt;/em&gt; teach you the basics of Metro.  All fine.  Now, let’s learn what changed.
I replaced marketing bullshit with the word &lt;em&gt;blah&lt;/em&gt;.  Everything that I said is
in &lt;em&gt;italics&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="using-windows"&gt;

&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Search.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;em&gt;blah blah blah&lt;/em&gt; Charms &lt;em&gt;blah blah blah&lt;/em&gt; apps&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Start.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;em&gt;blah blah blah&lt;/em&gt; replaced by Start &lt;em&gt;blah&lt;/em&gt; home base &lt;em&gt;blah&lt;/em&gt; open
apps &lt;em&gt;blah&lt;/em&gt; glance at the tiles &lt;em&gt;blah&lt;/em&gt; how to get there&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Desktop.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;em&gt;blah&lt;/em&gt; Desktop tile &lt;em&gt;blah&lt;/em&gt; Win+D&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Open Control Panel.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;em&gt;blah&lt;/em&gt; Control Panel &lt;em&gt;blah&lt;/em&gt; PC settings &lt;em&gt;blah&lt;/em&gt; searching &lt;em&gt;blah&lt;/em&gt; Settings
charm&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Help and Support.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;em&gt;blah&lt;/em&gt; Search &lt;em&gt;blah&lt;/em&gt; Settings→Help on Start &lt;em&gt;blah blah&lt;/em&gt; Settings→Help in apps
or &lt;em&gt;blah blah blah&lt;/em&gt; else &lt;em&gt;blah blah&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Turn off or shut down a PC.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oh, hi.  It’s you.  So, how are you holding up, shutdown magic?  Let’s
read about you.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;blah blah&lt;/em&gt; no need to shut down &lt;em&gt;blah&lt;/em&gt; sleep &lt;em&gt;blah&lt;/em&gt;
little power, faster startup, back to where you left off*—what?  So you
want people to put Windows to sleep now?  This capability is in Windows
since ages.  Congrats, Microsoft, on reminding yourself of its existence
and thus getting to tell people to do it the proper way!  Unless you use a
desktop PC, where it is almost always better to do a full halt.* &lt;em&gt;blah&lt;/em&gt;
default mode &lt;em&gt;blah&lt;/em&gt; close your lid or hit the power button &lt;em&gt;blah&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Hold on.
You want me to hit the power button?  I enabled this fancy
start-up-at-the-moment-in-which-you-get-power feature for &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;a
reason.&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;  Getting to the power button of my tower is not that easy.
I don’t want to duck so low. *  *blah&lt;/em&gt; change default mode to sleep &lt;em&gt;why
isn’t the it default?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah&lt;/em&gt; airplane
&lt;em&gt;blah&lt;/em&gt; not using &lt;em&gt;blah&lt;/em&gt; turn off &lt;em&gt;blah*close desktop apps blah save work
*blah&lt;/em&gt; settings charm &lt;em&gt;blah&lt;/em&gt; power &lt;em&gt;blah&lt;/em&gt; shut down &lt;em&gt;blah&lt;/em&gt;.  &amp;lt;/dl&amp;gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="using-apps"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Using apps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;dl class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Print.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Devices charm or Ctrl+P &lt;em&gt;blah blah blah&lt;/em&gt; no support &lt;em&gt;blah&lt;/em&gt; add&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;See all apps (programs). &lt;em&gt;Oh, back to the “programs” word?  What for?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;em&gt;blah&lt;/em&gt; All apps &lt;em&gt;blah&lt;/em&gt; keyboard search &lt;em&gt;blah&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Install apps.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;em&gt;blah&lt;/em&gt; Store &lt;em&gt;blah&lt;/em&gt; media &lt;em&gt;blah&lt;/em&gt; DVD &lt;em&gt;blah&lt;/em&gt; Internet &lt;em&gt;blah blah&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Microsoft account&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Add an account to an app. &lt;em&gt;WTF?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;blah&lt;/em&gt; create account if none &lt;em&gt;blah&lt;/em&gt; Settings→Accounts in app &lt;em&gt;blah&lt;/em&gt; Add &lt;em&gt;blah blah&lt;/em&gt; type &lt;em&gt;blah blah&lt;/em&gt; instructions.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Close an app.&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;Apps &lt;em&gt;blah blah&lt;/em&gt; from the Windows Store don’t slow down your PC, so you
don’t need to close them &lt;em&gt;blah blah&lt;/em&gt; close at random &lt;em&gt;blah&lt;/em&gt; close desktop
apps before shutodwn &lt;em&gt;blah&lt;/em&gt; drag from the top of the screen to the bottom
&lt;em&gt;BTW: why, exactly, this way? blah&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;blah&lt;/em&gt; left-side menu &lt;em&gt;blah&lt;/em&gt; drag to
bottom with touch, right-click and Close with a mouse &lt;em&gt;blah&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we have that.  Up next, Customize Start.  Standard.  How to use apps, or:
app commands (right-click/{↓,↑}swipe).  Those things are important, but are
also easily discoverable by mistake.  Switch between apps?  Standard
swipe-from-left/top-left corner thing, not so easy to find.  Also, app
snapping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, I still hate Windows 8.  And will hate it forever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Office 2013 (Office 15) Logo.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;On July 16th, Microsoft released a preview version of Office 2013.  Here is my review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;style&gt;
figure { width: 200px; min-height: 200px; float: right; text-align: center;}
.unlimitedfigure { width: auto; height: auto; min-width: 20px; min-height: 20px; float: none; }
&lt;/style&gt;&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="installation-attempt-1"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installation attempt #1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try to install the Preview from Microsoft site.  It uses a Metro-ish web installer, and the
first phase sits always on the top of my Windows (a big usability problem, because I was
doing some important work in other apps).  Somewhere in the process, it asked me to close
MSO, although I do not have it installed (except for Word/Excel/PowerPoint Viewers). I
allowed him to do so, and it crashed.  Afterwards, MSO apps did not work.  And I got a
million crash resolution windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="removal-attempt"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Removal attempt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As stated before, MSO apps did not work.  An attempt to fire one up resulted in a window
telling me to uninstall or repair them through Programs and Features.  I decided to do the
uninstall part.  It told me to reboot in order to clean up some stuff when I will have a
moment or two, and I have a lot of time, so I rebooted my machine.  The apps are left and
&lt;strong&gt;working&lt;/strong&gt;, but I have no way to uninstall them.  WTF?!  So I go to System Restore and
go back in time by two days.  Yes, two &lt;strong&gt;days&lt;/strong&gt;, not two &lt;strong&gt;minutes&lt;/strong&gt;.  This little idiot
did not create a restore point, and the one I have belongs to Windows Backup.  It looks like
Microsoft is trying to get rid of this feature.  Although it works much better than their fancy
reset/refresh stuff.  No traces of Office are visible.  Great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="installation-attempts-2-and-3"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Installation attempts #2 and #3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I try to install it the second time, I quit all the apps except WordPad (which currently
holds this text) and create a new restore point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try again.  And it looks like some stuff is still here.  Removed and created another restore
point.  Another attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/o15gal/img/install/install003.png" title="Installer splash screen (2/3)." class="fancybox" rel="o15gal"&gt;&lt;img src="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/o15gal/img/t/install/install003.png" alt="Installer splash screen (2/3)." title="Installer splash screen (2/3)."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Installer splash screen (2/3).&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I get the installer again.  The orange always-on-top window, check.  First installer
window, check.  On top of it, there is a window with a progress bar.  And it uses Windows
Classic controls.  No, I won’t love the new Office.  By the way, what is this thing’s name?
Office 365, Office 2013 or Office 15?  The first version is used by the Microsoft website, the
second is used by the Start Menu links, and the third one is used throughout the installer.
Oh: and the window employs fake Windows 8 controls.  Not only that, but it has the Metro-
style look, known from Zune for Windows or GitHub for Windows (shame on you, GitHub!).
Well, it worked, so let’s take a closer look at Office itself.  The installer told me to take a
look at an introduction about new stuff in Office.  It fires up a PowerPoint presentation with
four slides (sans a notification telling me to run a slideshow, which isn’t displayed in the
actual slideshow).  It looks like this version of office has two new features: abilities to
&lt;em&gt;make Office my own&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;access [files] anywhere&lt;/em&gt;.  That doesn’t look like a lot of new
features, does it? Another thing is that the presentation is in a 16:9 aspect ratio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/o15gal/img/install/install012.png" title="Introduction video (7/8)." class="fancybox" rel="o15gal"&gt;&lt;img src="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/o15gal/img/t/install/install012.png" alt="Introduction video (7/8)." title="Introduction video (7/8)."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Introduction video (7/8).&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I let the install finish and we’ll start the full review in just a moment (and the
install takes a longer moment).  When it was done, it told me that I could go offline or shut
down.  That isn’t a piece of useful advice in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/o15gal/img/install/install030.png" title="You’re good to go, showcasing a fake Windows 8 control." class="fancybox" rel="o15gal"&gt;&lt;img src="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/o15gal/img/t/install/install030.png" alt="You’re good to go, showcasing a fake Windows 8 control." title="You’re good to go, showcasing a fake Windows 8 control."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;You’re good to go, showcasing a fake Windows 8 control.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="word"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Word&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class="unlimitedfigure"&gt;
&lt;iframe width="640" height="480" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/CKPBPpPEMjc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;A video showcasing Word.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/o15gal/img/word/word008.png" title="Welcome to Word (Reading Mode: 1/4)" class="fancybox" rel="o15gal"&gt;&lt;img src="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/o15gal/img/t/word/word008.png" alt="Welcome to Word (Reading Mode: 1/4)" title="Welcome to Word (Reading Mode: 1/4)"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Welcome to Word (Reading Mode: 1/4)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I fired up Word.  It asked about file type associations.  I’m going to let it go with all of them.
I take the tour, and it shows me some new features (I also showcased the Read Mode,
mentioned by it).  That button left of the minimization button is the Full Screen button.
Let’s go to a real document and see what it can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “real” document is this blog post. I can notice some weird behavior while typing, the
cursor slides from letter to letter in a weird fashion.  I can also notice that the “typing” icon
in the status bar is broken.  For some reason, it displays itself and half of the second frame
of the animation.  An attempt to click on the icon got me to a spellcheck.  The “spellcheck
complete” window showcases the new style of text, telling me that I’m &lt;em&gt;good to go&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also noticed that .doc files use an icon similar to the one used by Word before version
2003.  It isn’t pretty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/o15gal/img/word/word018.png" title="This review with some formatting.

&lt;figcaption&gt;This review with some formatting. (word)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="office-15-in-general"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Office 15 in general&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used only two apps (and one just for ten seconds), but I can already notice the bad and good patterns in
the interface of Office 15.  Here they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Metro style everywhere, making it drop integration with everything else in the system.  The new icon
style isn’t pretty.
2. Love for sidebars.  And you can have two at the same side when there it feels like it.
3. » (guillemet) is used instead of (backslash) in paths.  Not a great idea.
4. Nobody seems to know what version of Office it is.
5. It loves to scream.  The Ribbon and the status bar have text in all-caps.  It’s harder to read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, back to testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="excel"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Excel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure class="unlimitedfigure"&gt;
&lt;iframe width="640" height="480" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/nq0l2PKXTR8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;A video showcasing Excel.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/o15gal/img/excel/excel013.png" title="Welcome to Excel: Quick Analysis (9/9)." class="fancybox" rel="o15gal"&gt;&lt;img src="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/o15gal/img/t/excel/excel013.png" alt="Welcome to Excel: Quick Analysis (9/9)." title="Welcome to Excel: Quick Analysis (9/9)."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Welcome to Excel: Quick Analysis (9/9).&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excel is a very useful app.  Right away, I go to the tour.
&lt;strong&gt;Flash Fill.&lt;/strong&gt; Seems to be nice, but here’s a catch: if you type out the whole name, it goes away and
you are forced to undo it or do it in the next row (deleting the contents and typing Andrew again doesn’t
work).
&lt;strong&gt;Quick Analysis.&lt;/strong&gt; Pretty.
&lt;strong&gt;Recommended charts.&lt;/strong&gt; Useless.
Then, I get some useless facts about Excel.  Once again, animated behavior, this time for selecting stuff
AND when value changes due to formulas.  Waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tested the last two with a document.  They failed.  Miserably.  The document is a list of games I
intend to buy soon. Item, Price in €, Price in PLN (converted), Importance (1-10), Source.  Easy.  Not for
Excel.  The first tab (formatting) gives the red color for the lower values.  And my list needs the reverse:
lower prices are better for me and have more chances of being bought soon, and the most important
games are marked with 1, not 10.  It isn’t customizable.  And the charts were even worse.  I have
absolutely no idea what they were supposed to mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;A video showcasing PowerPoint.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Up next, PowerPoint.  First thing I notice is that presentations are in a 16:9 ratio now.  Tour is useless.
Fancy effects for text input.  Stuff is also fading in on the slides panel on the left side.  Do not like.  And I
just passed 100 screenshots and 1100 words of the post.  And we aren’t even halfway through.  Also,
why doesn’t this idiot save locations of opening and saving between programs?  It would really help me.
Anyways, after saving my test presentation as &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;.ppt&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;.pptx&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;.pdf&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;.odp&lt;/tt&gt; (I am doing it
with every of those documents you’re seeing here), we continue with another application from the
Office suite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/o15gal/img/onenote/onenote002.png" title="OneNote: one place for all of your notes (1/3)." class="fancybox" rel="o15gal"&gt;&lt;img src="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/o15gal/img/t/onenote/onenote002.png" alt="OneNote: one place for all of your notes (1/3)." title="OneNote: one place for all of your notes (1/3)."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;OneNote: one place for all of your notes (1/3).&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It connects to a cloud.  So bad my Android phone doesn’t support OneNote (Gingerbread required, my
phone is at Froyo and won’t get an update).  I think that OneNote is a very useful app.  It is powerful.
And the clipping tool uses the new Windows logo.  Windows 8 users have no problem, same goes for
Windows 7 people who know about the change, but what about the rest of this universe (most of it,
actually)?  Other than that, I love OneNote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="outlook"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Outlook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/o15gal/img/outlook/outlook001.png" title="Welcome to Outlook 2013." class="fancybox" rel="o15gal"&gt;&lt;img src="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/o15gal/img/t/outlook/outlook001.png" alt="Welcome to Outlook 2013." title="Welcome to Outlook 2013."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Welcome to Outlook 2013.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Desktop mail clients…  I haven’t used one since a long time (if you don’t count the Mail app from
Windows 8, which isn’t a desktop app).
Anyways, it tells me that it’s &lt;em&gt;my personal assistant, helping me manage my life.&lt;/em&gt;  Good joke.  It doesn’t
have the features a &lt;em&gt;personal assistant&lt;/em&gt; of yours truly would need.  Nobody has such features, so I am
currently developing one to work with me.
And the next screens are the standard “new account creation” screens, which haven’t changed since the
beginning of time.  Oh wait, they did: fancy new dots are a progress indicator now.
Why did it change the color?  Before Office 2003, it was olive.  Then, it was a bit closer to yellow.  And
now it became light blue.  You’re breaking a very important thing.  Many people can distinguish Outlook
just by the color.  And Outlook is the most popular Office app in businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mail.&lt;/strong&gt; It starts a send/receive operation (0.4 GB, 9663 messages).  It takes a longer moment, so I go
to YouTube and watch Kikoskia’s new LP, The Legend of Kyrandia: Book One.  When it finished, the icon in
the Superbar changed.  A good idea.  I immediately search for a GOG.com newsletter (it’s a tradition)
and make a screenshot.  And I found an option to enable the conversation view, which is mandatory for
mail reading for me (this is why I’m using Gmail all the time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/o15gal/img/outlook/outlook008.png" title="The traditinal GOG.com newsletter." class="fancybox" rel="o15gal"&gt;&lt;img src="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/o15gal/img/t/outlook/outlook008.png" alt="The traditinal GOG.com newsletter." title="The traditinal GOG.com newsletter."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The traditinal GOG.com newsletter.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calendar.&lt;/strong&gt; A regular calendar, but doesn’t sync with Gmail nor Windows Live.  A very bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People.&lt;/strong&gt; Doesn’t sync, and still uses the Bill Gates mug shot as a default avatar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tasks.&lt;/strong&gt; Oddly enough, hovering on the icon displays my starred messages from Gmail.  No sync.  Not
worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also &lt;strong&gt;Notes&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Folders&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Shortcuts&lt;/strong&gt;, but I won’t show them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="access"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Access&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/o15gal/img/access/access008.png" title="A table." class="fancybox" rel="o15gal"&gt;&lt;img src="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/o15gal/img/t/access/access008.png" alt="A table." title="A table."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;A table.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Access.  The weird database manager.  The first template is &lt;em&gt;Custom web app.&lt;/em&gt;  I try, but it doesn’t seem
to work.  So I create a new desktop database, and I learn that it now creates &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;.accdb&lt;/tt&gt; files.  It does so
since version 2007, but I haven’t used Access since version 2003.  The suggested filename is &lt;em&gt;My New
App.accdb&lt;/em&gt;.
Access has changed since the last time I was here.  The standard window with all the objects is now a
sidebar.  It is no longer using the window-based style.  But I managed to work with the new style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="publisher"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Publisher&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/o15gal/img/publisher/publisher015.png" title="Gabriola, showing off its awesomeness." class="fancybox" rel="o15gal"&gt;&lt;img src="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/o15gal/img/t/publisher/publisher015.png" alt="Gabriola, showing off its awesomeness." title="Gabriola, showing off its awesomeness."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Gabriola, showing off its awesomeness.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use something else.  Seriously.  Publisher sucks.  I suggest LaTeX.  Anyways, the tour is downloaded from
the Internet this time.  And it showcases some neat features here.  It also supports typographical
features.  And I like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="touch-mode"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Touch Mode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A touch mode exists in this version of Office.  You activate it by the Quick Access toolbar (top-left part of
the title bar.)  It makes everything bigger so you can hit it with your finger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="unlimitedfigure"&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="conclusion"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This piece of software is not a thing I like.  I hate fake Metro.  It isn’t pretty.
To comply with the tradition of my reviews, ratings and galleries were made.  Another new thing are the
examples, which are the documents used in this review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong style="font-size: 3em;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://kwpolska.tk/o15gal/" title="Office 2013 Gallery"&gt;Office 2013 Gallery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong style="font-size: 3em;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://sdrv.ms/NGklkc" title="Office 2013 Files"&gt;Office 2013 Files&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong style="font-size: 3em;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB53D5EB93251C38E" title="Office 2013 Videos"&gt;Office 2013 Videos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;The files are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" class="table table-striped docutils"&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col width="18%"&gt;
&lt;col width="18%"&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody valign="top"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;word&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Word&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The review, formatted for Word.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;excel&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Excel&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ratings table.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Excel-2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Excel&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;access&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Access&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ratings.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;publisher&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Publisher&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A sample document, showcasing Gabriola.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Files are available in PDF, old Office, new office (.*x) format and OpenDocument formats, where
available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="ratings"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ratings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table border="1" class="table table-striped docutils"&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody valign="top"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Office 15&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Metro is already bad, fake Metro is even worse.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Word&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Meh.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Excel&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The Quick Analysis mode fails sometimes.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;PowerPoint&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Don’t like several features.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;OneNote&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A brilliant app.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Outlook&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;I do not like offline mail clients.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Access&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A lot of changes since 2003.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Publisher&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Not the best app for doing such stuff.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Average&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6.125&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A fair rating.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post was brought to you by Word 2013 and SkyDrive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img src="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/logos/win8rp.png" alt="Windows 8 Logo." title="Windows 8 Logo."&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Windows 8 Logo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft released Windows 8 Release Preview on Friday, June 1st.  And I just wanted to start a game playthrough on Sunday.  Wish me luck, as I want to do both ASAP.  Here we go again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice: Please read &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://kwpolska.tk/blog/2012/03/05/a-look-at-windows-8-consumer-preview/"&gt;A Look at Windows 8 Consumer Preview&lt;/a&gt; first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;style&gt;
figure { width: 200px; min-height: 200px; float: right; text-align: center;}
.unlimitedfigure { width: auto; height: auto; min-width: 20px; min-height: 20px; float: none; }
&lt;/style&gt;&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="deja-vu-time-setup"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Déjà vu time: Setup.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another offer of an &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;.exe&lt;/tt&gt;.  I did not accept it.  Downloaded the ISO, it was quite fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I created a new VDI and ran the ISO.  I was greeted by a screen with the Windows word on it and a throbber (not depicted on the screen, shot it too fast).  Notice that the word doesn’t look quite right.  It is made for 16:9 screens: when you do use a 16:9 screen (depicted in the image gallery), it is stretched, what gets its proper look back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The setup program hasn’t changed too much.  But in the Repair section, the fonts look a tiny bit different and CMD’s scrollbar is now Metro-ish.  And Microsoft changed the setup icon again: now it's an arrow pointing to a screen.  Or: a tablet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the product key screen, I discovered that the right-click menu style is from Office XP or Windows Whistler betas, released eleven years ago.  And I am dead serious.  Just look at it.  Apparently, Microsoft loves going back to the past: in terms of movement, Metro apps are even more limited than Windows 1.0.  Especially when you’re a few pixels short from the “proper” screen resolutions according to Microsoft.  And when you need more than ⅓ or ⅔ of your screen for your apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/w8rpgal/img/menucomparison.png" title="Menus comparison." class="fancybox" rel="w8rpgal"&gt;&lt;img src="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/w8rpgal/img/t/menucomparison.png" alt="Menus comparison." title="Menus comparison."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Menus comparison.  Office XP and Whistler images courtesy &lt;a href="http://winsupersite.com"&gt;Paul Thurrot’s SuperSite for Windows&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;License screen, the same scrollbar as in CMD.  I came back to the CMD immediately.  Right-clicked the titlebar and I got even more new UI elements.  New buttons and other controls.  (keep in mind that the setup is composed of images of fake controls and even more fake glass, which hasn’t changed to reflect the new glass.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/w8rpgal/img/ss006.png" title="Setup: New controls in CMD." class="fancybox" rel="w8rpgal"&gt;&lt;img src="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/w8rpgal/img/t/ss006.png" alt="Setup: New controls in CMD." title="Setup: New controls in CMD."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Setup: New controls in CMD.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, why do they even ask me for the product key?  There is one for the whole world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the install finished, let’s say hi to our new OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restart.  Getting stuff ready.  Restart.  The boot logo is still for 16:9 displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/w8rpgal/img/ss010.png" title="New Windows boot logo." class="fancybox" rel="w8rpgal"&gt;&lt;img src="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/w8rpgal/img/t/ss010.png" alt="New Windows boot logo." title="New Windows boot logo."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;New Windows boot logo.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;And we go through the OOBE again.  First change: MORE COLORS!  Then I decided not to choose express settings, although this won’t make a big difference.  Sign in with a Microsoft account?  Sure, but first I look at the “local account” procedure, which gives you the details of both choices, something that should be displayed instead of the Microsoft login prompt.  Put in my e-mail address, I do exist, I am asked for my password, I give it,  then I get a request for &lt;em&gt;security verification info&lt;/em&gt;.  I like that idea.  Done.  Creating my account.  Hold on for a second, a new mail message.  It tells me that I added a phone number to my account.  Good to know.  Back to writing this post.  Another one!  A new mail address.  Ten seconds pass,  you’ve got mail!  They want me to confirm this PC as a trusted PC.  So be it, we click all the three links and go back to Windows 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/w8rpgal/img/ss015.png" title="First Boot: Personalize." class="fancybox" rel="w8rpgal"&gt;&lt;img src="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/w8rpgal/img/t/ss015.png" alt="First Boot: Personalize." title="First Boot: Personalize."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;First Boot: Personalize.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="welcome-to-windows-8"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Welcome to Windows 8!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It greeted me with a different start screen wallpaper, a quite pretty Desktop wallpaper, and without my avatar.  After a short while, the Desktop tile went black (so did my wallpaper) and the Photos tile now displays photos from my SkyDrive.  App rundown?  APP RUNDOWN!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mail.&lt;/strong&gt;  Can’t see a change since last time.  And you get to see YET ANOTHER GOG.COM NEWSLETTER.  They know when to send one.  And they’re awesome.  But I just noticed an overall UI change: the toolbar-ish things accessed by a right-click now get the selected item displayed in a square.  That's made especially for PCs, as you can now use this from your keyboard.  And yes, that fancy Menu key on your keyboard (left of Right Ctrl) does work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People.&lt;/strong&gt;  Again, my Android/Google contacts list appear.  My login details are shared from Mail.  And I just noticed that the wait cursor changed.  It is now a plain light blue square with a bit darker.  Metro style.  Then I notice that EVERY SINGLE password input offers you a button to see your password, and every other input field has an × button to quickly erase.  And I am now authenticating &lt;em&gt;Application for Windows Phone (via Windows Live)&lt;/em&gt;.  It says it will take a few minutes, much longer than my Gmail account.  I won’t even bother waiting.  Or wait, it’s done!  New tile: I get to see 5 avatars of people I follow on Twitter (as my Google contacts don’t have any as I never bothered and don’t even care.  But I DO get to see my Google avatar out there sometimes.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Messaging.&lt;/strong&gt; Supports WLM and Facebook only.  I am not very happy about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Desktop is left for the end, so &lt;strong&gt;Calendar.&lt;/strong&gt;  And I see three calendars: Windows Live Mail (light blue), GMail (green) and National Holidays (purple).  I also noticed that I forgot to put an event somewhere.  Fixed.  Quite nice way to manage your stuff.  (on a related note: my clock is set terribly wrong and I can’t easily change that.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photos.&lt;/strong&gt;  SkyDrive, kwpolska-win, Pictures lib— hold on for a second.  Kwpolska-win?  Those are all the photos from my Windows 7 with SkyDrive.  Nice.  Anyways: Pictures library, Facebook, Flickr.  And a pretty background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video&lt;/strong&gt; (Xbox Live-related).  Just some video-related stuff, you can also watch your local videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weather.&lt;/strong&gt; Location services will fail, so we won’t use them.  Instead of getting Seattle as a default, I get to enter my location.  Let’s get quite close to myself and let’s choose Celsius.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internet Explorer&lt;/strong&gt; (10).  I want to enter an address, but I see that &lt;strong&gt;it remembered my history from Consumer Preview.&lt;/strong&gt;  Useless for me.  Shot a screenshot of my website, and I got the new wait cursor on the image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Store.&lt;/strong&gt;  No changes since last time.  Installing (for an additional test): msnbc.com, Evernote, Fruit Ninja and Wikipedia.   The store connection failed quite often.  The “try again” link out there failed to work.  So bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maps.&lt;/strong&gt;  No, not gonna use location services.  First of, scrolling to zoom doesn’t work, and it sucks.  Second of, my city sucks on the map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SkyDrive.&lt;/strong&gt;  Still awesome, just as in CP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Music.&lt;/strong&gt; Same as Video.  This time, I get to play some local music, from Portal 2 OST.  The background doesn’t showcase MY songs, I do not have any other music in my SkyDrive.  Overall, it’s a nice management UI.  Although I won’t use one, as all music management on this machine belongs to MPD (even on Windows, a bit cheaty setup, but worth it)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/w8rpgal/img/ss059.png" title="Music: Playlist: Portal 2 OST." class="fancybox" rel="w8rpgal"&gt;&lt;img src="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/w8rpgal/img/t/ss059.png" alt="Music: Playlist: Portal 2 OST." title="Music: Playlist: Portal 2 OST."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Music: Playlist: Portal 2 OST.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xbox LIVE Games.&lt;/strong&gt;  That should be pretty much obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Camera.&lt;/strong&gt;  Don’t have one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;News.&lt;/strong&gt; We encounter a new app: Bing News.  It should be obvious what it means.  New live tile!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sports.&lt;/strong&gt; I hate those.  Bing Sports.  Nothing more.  Live tile unlocked.  Sort of like game achievements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Travel.&lt;/strong&gt;  Bing Travel.  Live tile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finance.&lt;/strong&gt; Yup, you’ve guessed it: Bing Finance + another live tile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, while we’re at it, our 4 new apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*Evernote.*&lt;/strong&gt; A nice app, I must admit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*News on msnbc.com.*&lt;/strong&gt;  Better than the Bing News.  Pretty.  I also learned something.  (see the gallery if you wanna know what do I mean)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*Fruit Ninja.*&lt;/strong&gt;  What does that × mean?  Oh, it’s broken.  Great.  It can’t be fixed by Windows 8.  What do you expect?  Like something is gonna work here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*Wikipedia.*&lt;/strong&gt;  Works okay, but it could’ve been better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="summary"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apps rundown: quite good apps out there.  Lotsa live tiles, and that’s good.  But this thing has HORRIBLE NOTIFICATION SYSTEM.  Can’t they copy the great system from many mobile OSes, like Android or iOS?  Once a notification disappears, it’s gone forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here comes my start screen state right now. (dropped the desktop background for a second or two)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="unlimitedfigure"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/w8rpgal/img/ss083.png" title="Full Metro start screen." class="fancybox" rel="w8rpgal"&gt;&lt;img src="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/w8rpgal/img/t/ss083.png" alt="Full Metro start screen." title="Full Metro start screen."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Full Metro start screen.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="settings-rundown"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Settings rundown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to run down all the settings you get.  Fire up charms, Settings, More PC Settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personalize.&lt;/strong&gt; Nothing new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Users.  Notifications.  Search.  Share.&lt;/strong&gt; Obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General&lt;/strong&gt; or settings-we-couldn’t-fit-anywhere-else.  I get to set my clock properly, and &lt;em&gt;Advanced startup&lt;/em&gt; = F8 in older Windowses.  TODO DOES F8 WORK TODO PORTAL 2 SS&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy.&lt;/strong&gt; Standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Devices.&lt;/strong&gt; You can choose not to download drivers on metered connections.  For crying out loud, who cares?  People on tablets don’t even NEED drivers!  And people on the desktop wouldn’t want to wait for them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/w8rpgal/img/ss094.png" title="PC settings: Devices.

&lt;figcaption&gt;PC settings: Devices.  Note the “Download over metered connections” section.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ease of Access.  Sync your settings.  HomeGroup.  Windows Update.&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t even ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was quite short, wasn’t it?  But I covered them in the CP review, and they haven’t changed much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="desktop"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;DESKTOP&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the desktop.  First of, let’s change our wallpaper.  I have no idea why it’s black, but let’s get back to the default one.  Right click, Office XP menu.  Personalize, and I get to see new stuff.  Everything lost its glassy Aero feel.  It is now much different.  It is more Metro-ish.  Look below: many controls at once, as many as I can put on one screen.  They aren’t pretty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="unlimitedfigure"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/w8rpgal/img/ss104.png" title="Most of the new UI elements on one screen." class="fancybox" rel="w8rpgal"&gt;&lt;img src="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/w8rpgal/img/t/ss104.png" alt="Most of the new UI elements on one screen." title="Most of the new UI elements on one screen."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Most of the new UI elements on one screen.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;There isn’t, unfortunately, too much to showcase in terms of apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But!  In terms of OS behavior, I found a few changes.  I also noticed that it takes AGES to shut the system down or to sign into the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of, I wanted to play my music in the Music app.  I could’ve just clicked on something and it would play, but I wanted to have it locally forever and I wanted my playlist to work.  I wanted to play the Portal 2 OST, which is in my SkyDrive.  The only option I found was to select a file and then use &lt;em&gt;Save local&lt;/em&gt;.  I could also select more than one.  I found an easier and faster solution: downloading a &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;.zip&lt;/tt&gt; from skydrive.live.com.  But later, I decided to actually try this &lt;em&gt;Save local&lt;/em&gt; thing.  It did its job right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I tried to play a .m3u file, I got a Metro-style window asking me whether it should use Music or Windows Media Player. (screenshots depict “Open with”.)  I do not like that.  Mixing two environments went too far here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I created a .bmp file on my desktop.  It had the icon of Photos from Metro.  When it opened, I got a notification: “You have new apps that can open this type of file.”  Clicked and I got yet another window of this style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/w8rpgal/img/ss115.png" title="Photos: You have new apps that can open this type of file. (1/2)" class="fancybox" rel="w8rpgal"&gt;&lt;img src="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/w8rpgal/img/t/ss115.png" alt="Photos: You have new apps that can open this type of file. (1/2)" title="Photos: You have new apps that can open this type of file. (1/2)"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Photos: You have new apps that can open this type of file. (1/2)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="control-panel"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Control Panel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They had to change stuff and drop everything related with the old Windows.  First of, System and Security in Control Panel’s category view have a plain blue shield instead of one with the Windows flag colors.  (Windows 7 CP included for comparison;  visual style is Soft7 2.0)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we have some changes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add features to Windows 8.&lt;/strong&gt;  Or: Windows Anytime Upgrade.  It’s broken now, but in the future it will handle Windows 8 → Windows 8 Pro + Media Center OR Windows 8 Pro → Windows 8 Pro + Media Center.  Media Center will also allow DVD playback, &lt;strong&gt;NOT POSSIBLE BY DEFAULT.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And please welcome &lt;strong&gt;The new Windows Update icon!&lt;/strong&gt;  Seriously, Microsoft, decide.  All the three iterations of Windows 8 had a different one.  DP had the old one, CP had one without a Windows logo, RP has yet another one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/w8rpgal/img/ss119.png" title="Control Panel: Windows Update’s new icon." class="fancybox" rel="w8rpgal"&gt;&lt;img src="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/w8rpgal/img/t/ss119.png" alt="Control Panel: Windows Update’s new icon." title="Control Panel: Windows Update’s new icon."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Control Panel: Windows Update’s new icon.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Family Safety.&lt;/strong&gt;  Or: Parental Controls.  Now for weird human-like colorful WLM icons.  This OS is not made for humans!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Language.&lt;/strong&gt;  I see all my CP languages.  But can’t get a languge pack for German.  Why didn’t they make it available if I can download the ISO file WITH GERMAN?  Another change is that UK English displays “A language pack isn’t available.”  Yup, the Brits are gonna get their language in Windows.  I, for one, don’t think it would be of use, but some Brits apparently don’t like col*or*ful fav*or*ites in the cent*er* of this piece of shi*t.*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="editions-languages-troubleshooting"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Editions, Languages, Troubleshooting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an old post, redux.  It was lost when my server was vaporized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="editions"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Editions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This thing is gonna have five editions.  But you can’t get exactly all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Windows 8.&lt;/strong&gt;  The standard version.  Nothing specific.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Windows 8 Pro.&lt;/strong&gt;  With some more advanced features.  Meh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Windows 8 Pro + Media Center.&lt;/strong&gt;  In order to play DVDs or use Media Center, you will need to pay.  And if you bought regular Windows 8, you need to upgrade to Pro+WMC to use WMC capabilities.  But if you only want the “advanced” features of Pro, you need to pay for the Media Center.  No way to skip that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Windows 8 Enterprise.&lt;/strong&gt;  Obvious, expensive, can’t get your hands on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Windows RT.&lt;/strong&gt;  WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS, may you ask?  The answer is easy.  ARM version of Windows 8.  Without any desktop apps, except Office (free with your DEVICE with RT, as you &lt;em&gt;can’t buy this in stores.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can test the Pro + Media Center version now.  Sure, we’ll do that.  Entering the key provided by Microsoft, it works.  Reboot.  Adding features in logonui.  Reboot.  Long wait.  Preparing to configure Windows.  And I finally get my lock screen.  And a WMC icon appeared at the end of my Start screen.  I click on it and I am informed that I’m all done and my PC is ready to go.  Well, I should see that message AFTER THE BOOT, not when I start the Desktop app.  Very bad design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing is that my desktop now says “Windows 8 Release Preview with Media Center”.  And that it started to lag when I started WMC.  And WMC is the EXACT SAME THING as in Windows 7 Home Premium/Ultimate, the one included FOR FREE.  Waste of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="languages"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Languages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dropping this bit.  Basically, I had some weird fun with my system locale and also showcased a bit of German in CP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="troubleshooting"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Troubleshooting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, VirtualBox Guest Additions told me that there is an update for them.  Sure, I do want an update.  Installing, installing, and OH SHIT IT FUCKED MY SYSTEM UP.  I got a black screen.  Ctrl-Alt-Del changes the color to the fancy #004050 used by the whole Metro stuff as its background, but can’t see anything displayed.  So I asked the CD for help.  I noticed that it is a great way to test Refresh and Reset the PC features of Windows 8.  It would be a great way, but BOTH OF THEM FAILED.  Refresh worked for 15 minutes and did nothing.  Restart finished doing nothing instantly.  So I chose Advanced options.  I saw System Restore here.  System Restore is a tool included since Windows ME, year 2000.  IT WORKED PERFECTLY.  The only thing that was weird after the first reboot is my system language, as Metro went German.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if we’re talking about Windows ME, it loved squares and blockiness.  It was a failure, loved to crash, had no DOS mode, replaced by XP after less than a year.  Replace &lt;em&gt;XP&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;em&gt;9&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;no DOS mode&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;em&gt;Explorer desktop with less meaning than ever before&lt;/em&gt; and you have &lt;strong&gt;my future prediction for Windows 8&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="summary-and-additions"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Summary and additions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This thing is not great.  Metro and Desktop don’t work great together.  Microsoft tries to fix that by creating the new visual style, rensembling Office XP, with a more Metro-ish and blocky feeling, but IT SUCKS.  Dropping the Start button makes it even harder to use.  Sure, there are some new great features, like the Task Manager or the awesome multi-monitor support, but Metro makes it all worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also couldn’t put my computer to sleep, nor hibernate it.  There is no such feature in Windows 8, at least under VirtualBox.  I have no data whether it is available on an actual PC right now, but I will fix that soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After installing WMC, Windows Media Player used my PC too much.  Over 90%, sometimes even 95%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also had a better idea: upload something to my SkyDrive.  I couldn’t create a new directory in the SkyDrive app.  Are you serious?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concludes my review of Windows 8 Release Preview.  I suggest looking at the gallery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong style="font-size: 3em;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://kwpolska.tk/w8rpgal/" title="Windows 8 RP Gallery"&gt;Windows 8 RP Gallery&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you do care about weird numbers and ratings, here you go:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" class="table table-striped docutils"&gt;
&lt;colgroup&gt;
&lt;col width="33%"&gt;
&lt;col width="7%"&gt;
&lt;col width="60%"&gt;
&lt;/colgroup&gt;
&lt;thead valign="bottom"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th class="head"&gt;Component&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class="head"&gt;Rating&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th class="head"&gt;Comment&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody valign="top"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Mail, People, Messaging, Calendar&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Quite nice, love the integration.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Photos&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Good photo management.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Videos, Music, Xbox LIVE Games&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Awesome apps for entertaining yourself.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Internet Explorer 10 (Metro)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A nice browser, but Metro isn’t good for it.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Store&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Doesn’t load the pages sometimes, slow overall.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Maps&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;No mouse wheel zoom.  Uses Bing Maps.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;SkyDrive&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;An awesome app.  But it doesn’t offer anything on the Desktop.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Camera&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Doesn’t work.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;News, Sports, Travel, Finance&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Quite nice apps.  Bing-based, don’t like that.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Explorer Shell&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ribbons don’t work.  Same goes for no Start button.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Internet Explorer 10 (Desktop)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A nice browser with a good UI.  Chrome is better, though.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Visual Style&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Are we in Windows Whistler?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Metro&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Do not like that concept.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Desktop&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;They broke the desktop.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Windows 8 RP overall&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4.75&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;A fair rating, and very close to the ratings average.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once again, seeing this on Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and what-you-have would be awesome.  Thanks for reading this review.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This review was brought to you by Geany.  (the previous one was written using Word Web App, but it was an overkill.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Windows 8 Consumer Preview’s Logo, from the Setup wizard (for older Windows versions)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I said at the end of the logo rant, I reviewed Windows 8.  The third part of the &amp;lt;del&amp;gt;Twilight&amp;lt;/del&amp;gt; Windows 8 saga, and the biggest one.  I am going to post more stuff about it in the future, but here it is: the Kwpolska Windows 8 Consumer Preview Review.  Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Let’s Download It, Shall We Not?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/w8cp/img/ss001.png" title="The Setup wizard (for older Windows versions)." class="fancybox" rel="w8reviewfbox"&gt;&lt;img src="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/w8cp/img/t/ss001.png" alt="The Setup wizard (for older Windows versions)." title="The Setup wizard (for older Windows versions)."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The Setup wizard (for older Windows versions).&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows 8 was up at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/consumer-preview"&gt;Microsoft’s site&lt;/a&gt;, so I got there.  I was offered an &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;.exe&lt;/tt&gt;.  I ran it and I got the Upgrade Advisor from Windows 7, only modified.  It started with a splash screen with the terrible new &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://kwpolska.tk/blog/2012/02/25/new-windows-logo-yet-another-stupid-idea/"&gt;logo&lt;/a&gt;, and then I got the Setup window.  Fun (not so) fact: it used the Windows Update icon, only without the logo.  Then, I got my product key.  It was not the end of the fun: it wished to download it on its own, followed by updates.  Normally, I’d get angry and throw it out of the window (read: kill the app and destroy the file), but I promised to do a review here and I had to keep it.  Then, I noticed I could get an ISO.  Beautiful.  Why wasn’t the link a bit more visible?  There we go, I don’t need the key I got, we can happily kill this piece of crap (and it didn't show me the progress on the taskbar button, like Chrome would do), I’ll grab the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/iso"&gt;ISO&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="time-to-install"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Time To Install.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/w8cp/img/ss002.png" title="The boot screen." class="fancybox" rel="w8reviewfbox"&gt;&lt;img src="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/w8cp/img/t/ss002.png" alt="The boot screen." title="The boot screen."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The boot screen.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/w8cp/img/ss004.png" title="The installer’s welcome page." class="fancybox" rel="w8reviewfbox"&gt;&lt;img src="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/w8cp/img/t/ss004.png" alt="The installer’s welcome page." title="The installer’s welcome page."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The installer’s welcome page.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wiped my Windows 8 Developer Preview VDI (I played with it for a while) and installed the Consumer Preview.  The installer is the same as in Windows Vista and 7.  Well, not exactly.  The boot screen is a fish.  Then, you are greeted by the language selection screen, featuring the new logo.  The next screen (&lt;em&gt;Install now&lt;/em&gt;) drops the arrow icon before the text.  Hitting &lt;em&gt;Repair your computer&lt;/em&gt; activates a new screen (Metro-ish).  But we’ll continue with the actual installation process.  I get a screen asking for the product key.  I type my key using the virtual keyboard (pictured, it works nicely) and continued.  Then, I got the standard steps: license agreement and disk partitioning.  The installer started its work.  And, before you ask: the Windows logo in the setup program’s title bar has been replaced by the Windows Update icon without a logo.  And the fake Aero border is still the same style as Vista/7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Welcome to Windows 8 Consumer Preview.  You Won’t Enjoy Your Stay.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Out of The Box Experience: the first page.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows 8 was successfully installed.  Great.  It wants me to reboot, so we’ll do that, this makes sense, as I am not aware of any OS which can move its environment from the CD to the HDD without one.  Then, I get greeted by the new boot screen (again, a fish) and I get some more configuring.  Preparing, updating the registry settings, getting devices ready, getting system ready, rebooting.  Okay, it may be needed, 7 did without it, but the architecture changed, so I’ll let it continue.  Next, I get a Metro setup wizard.  I get to name my PC (according to my naming schemes, this becomes kwpolska-egh) and to choose a color.  And no, I can’t say #00AADD nor #0000C1 (my standard colors).  Instead, I can “decide” between: teal, charcoal, dark blue, purple, plum, dark red, brown, green, light gray. They are not standard colors, instead some weird shades.  I chose the default teal color.  Next, I get to choose some other settings, the express settings proposed by Microsoft are okay, so I am going to stay with them.  Next, I need to sign in with Windows Live (there is also a link to create a local account).  A screen asks me to wait.  This screen is a bit different: it features darker bars at the top and the bottom of the screen.  It reminds me of Windows XP’s login screen.  Next, I get to type in my password.  On the right side of the screen, there is an icon for displaying your password in plain text (and there is a character limit of about 16 characters — if this is a technical limitation, Microsoft stores your password in &lt;strong&gt;plain text&lt;/strong&gt; or with &lt;strong&gt;very poor encryption&lt;/strong&gt;.)   Creating my account, and then, guess what happens.  Auto-login?  No.  Regular login screen?  Nope, try again.   A reboot?  Yes, you’re right.  Third reboot in such a short while.  Come on Microsoft!  You can do without it.  You did it three years ago, in Windows 7.  There was only one reboot before I got to the desktop in it.  But anyways, I got some more Preparing of Windows (like once is not enough), and welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-is-going-on"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is going on?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/w8cp/img/ss018.png" title="The Start Screen (page 1/2)" class="fancybox" rel="w8reviewfbox"&gt;&lt;img src="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/w8cp/img/t/ss018.png" alt="The Start Screen (page 1/2)." title="The Start Screen (page 1/2)"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The Start Screen (page 1/2)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I get the Start screen.  It is clearly tablet-oriented.  But I have a better question: where can I manage my settings?  Where can I change my screen resolution?  Is there no Control Panel?  Don’t force me to get to Aero desktop, this will be the last thing I do in this review.  I finally get here.  Can you guess how?  Chris Warrick → Change account picture.  WHAT THE FUCK?  Anyways, let’s take a look at the settings.  Lock screen settings.  I get to choose anything as its wallpaper (including some pictures by Microsoft) and some apps that run in the background while the screen is locked to provide notifications (e.g. new mail notifications).  Start screen settings.  I get to choose from predefined textures as the wallpaper and the same colors as before (no customization at all).  Account picture should be obvious.  Then, Users.  Except for the picture password, nothing specific.  I set my picture password to &lt;em&gt;three taps on the Turn off your PC button in the Troubleshooting menu in the setup&lt;/em&gt; (the setup pictures were already uploaded to my SkyDrive.)  Notifications, Search, Share, all obvious.  General, or rather &lt;em&gt;stuff that didn’t fit anywhere else&lt;/em&gt;, is the time settings (of course, the time zone settings are wrong), app switching, spelling, language settings (a link to Aero Desktop’s Control Panel!) and PC refreshing/resetting.  Refresh is a new idea, which is removing all the apps, but keeping your personal data.  Reset will put Windows to a condition close to a brand new install.  That may be useful for some people, actually.  The last &lt;em&gt;General&lt;/em&gt; thing is &lt;em&gt;Advanced startup&lt;/em&gt;, which is close to hitting F8 on the boot manager of older Windows versions (and sometimes praying for it to bring the menu up), only with a few more options.  Privacy, Devices, Ease of Access, Sync your Settings, HomeGroup, Windows Update.  Obvious, only a side note for Windows Update: if you want to choose which updates you want to install, you need to &lt;strong&gt;switch to Aero Desktop’s Control Panel.&lt;/strong&gt;  Yes, something that easy apparently requires a window.  It found 5 updates on March 2nd, so I installed them and I proceeded further.  I wasn’t able to change my resolution (even though I won’t do that, because I want to have all the screenshots in the same size).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="apps-apps-apps"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Apps, Apps, Apps!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/w8cp/img/ss035.png" title="Store app." class="fancybox" rel="w8reviewfbox"&gt;&lt;img src="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/w8cp/img/t/ss035.png" alt="Store app." title="Store app."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Store app.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back to the Start screen.  Let’s begin with the &lt;strong&gt;Store.&lt;/strong&gt;  Since last time, it got a &lt;em&gt;4&lt;/em&gt; in the bottom right corner.  We venture further.  The four meant four updates (obviously).  I installed Cut the Rope, just for getting to know the process.  (hint: it’s slow as hell).  I also installed the updates (and you can select which updates you want to install!).  1 app down, 19 left (I won’t showcase Cut the Rope and don’t count Desktop and Windows Explorer as apps, as this section deals only with Metro apps).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up next, &lt;strong&gt;Xbox LIVE Games.&lt;/strong&gt;  Just some news, games and achievements, nothing specific.  Well, except for the fact that my avatar looks like shit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maps.&lt;/strong&gt;  The search function fails miserably, but directions work.  Once again, the map looks like shit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internet Explorer 10, Metro edition.&lt;/strong&gt; I am actually using this app since a while (writing this very blog post, in Word Web App, on my SkyDrive, with mixed Markdown-Office formatting, as you can see on the screenshot).  There is only one problem: it does not work well.  There are barely any instructions.  I don’t know what to do when I need to search the Web.  I work using the keyboard shortcuts, but that is not easy.  There is no help for version 10 whatsoever.  Am I being forced to include the S-word at the end of almost every review?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and time for a last-minute discovery.  There is another way to get to the settings.  Press Windows+C or put the mouse in the top right corner of your screen.  Hit Settings and click &lt;em&gt;More PC Settings&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;strong&gt;HOW IS SOMEONE SUPPOSED TO KNOW ABOUT THAT?!&lt;/strong&gt; One more thing: this brings up a menu for the app you are using now.  I’d use the obvious word, but I don’t want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a screenshot of IE (in a very weird way), and let’s continue.  I’d go with &lt;strong&gt;Video&lt;/strong&gt;.  You can watch some movies and TV shows (same as Xbox), and that’s all it can do.  I won’t show you a screenshot, because I’d get sued by copyright owners, but it’s similar to Xbox LIVE Games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You won’t get the Desktop now, but I’ll give you &lt;strong&gt;Photos&lt;/strong&gt; instead.  Or I won’t, because it’s obvious: it displays photos (note: SkyDrive is available if you wait).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s next?  &lt;strong&gt;Messaging.&lt;/strong&gt; Windows Live Messenger + Facebook Chat.  Useful, but I won’t showcase anything specific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mail.&lt;/strong&gt; It asked me for my Gmail password.  It noticed that I am using a Gmail address for my Live account and want mail from here.  Cool.  It showed my mailbox.  It crashed when I tried to open some mails (like the GOG one, pictured), but otherwise it can do its job good.  It will also show the unread mail count on the Start screen tile.  Unfortunately, it doesn’t support conversation view, and therefore sucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me interrupt with one more last minute discovery in IE 10: it shows a tab bar when you press the right mouse button.  The only problem is: Word Web App steals it.  I discovered it while I was saving the document, which took ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weather.&lt;/strong&gt; I fire it up and — whoah. — It wants to enable location services and locate me.  I say no, even though it would fail no matter what.  It looks kind of nice, but it doesn’t allow human temperature units (degrees Celsius).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calendar.&lt;/strong&gt; I see my Google calendar events.  Yeah, you’ve guessed it: it uses the same details as Mail.  It displays my events on the tile and the lock screen.  It works okay, except I need to sync my events in the Mail app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People.&lt;/strong&gt; Similar to People on Windows Phone 7, it displays all the people I have in my contacts or friends from all over the web.  It presents people from my Gmail/Android contacts list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Games: Pinball FX and Solitaire.&lt;/strong&gt; Just games.  And solitaire offers me to log into Xbox LIVE.  And displays Visit ESRB.com for rating information.  Now it is a full-class game!  (and I didn’t even bother with the other game.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Camera.&lt;/strong&gt; Doesn’t work on a PC, at least if you don’t have a webcam.  Useless for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xbox Companion.&lt;/strong&gt; Like I didn’t have enough Xbox apps.  And it is useless because I don’t own an Xbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Music.&lt;/strong&gt;  Same thing as Videos, only for music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SkyDrive.&lt;/strong&gt;  This is a desktop client for SkyDrive.  It is really nice and useful.  I hope to get one for Windows 7 soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remote Desktop.&lt;/strong&gt; Don’t have a place to connect to (Windows 7 Home Premium has no Remote Desktop Server), so it’s useless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finance.&lt;/strong&gt; Or: Bing Finance news.  Thus, useless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reader.&lt;/strong&gt; It reads PDFs and XPFs.  Yes, it supports PDFs.  Finally Windows has support for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/w8cp/img/ss056.png" title="The Start screen in its full glory." class="fancybox" rel="w8reviewfbox"&gt;&lt;img src="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/w8cp/img/t/ss056.png" alt="The Start screen in its full glory." title="The Start screen in its full glory."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The Start screen in its full glory.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then we get Explorer and Cut The Rope.  I won’t show them (at least now).  That is the end of our apps review.  The Start screen has changed a bit, so I took another screenshot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="a-short-break"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A short break&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just for the sake of it, I created a new account.  I looked at it and then wanted to get rid of it.  Good news: you can’t do this in Metro.  You need to switch to the Aero desktop.  (I did this later.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="summary"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wait, there’s more: a global comment. Even though most of the apps I reviewed worked nicely, they felt made specifically for tablets and not regular computers.  Everything was giant.  My mouse made a lot of movements.  Many things were hidden in the right-click “menus” (similar to the Android hardware Menu button).  This is not nice.  It was not the best experience.  It would work nicely on a tablet, but Metro (still) sucks on regular (mouse + keyboard) hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But will I ever need to use Metro if I would switch to Windows 8 (not very likely, as I bought a Windows 7 license a while ago)?  I don’t think so.  I have most of my apps I use often pinned to the taskbar in Windows 7.  Out of them, only one is Metro-ized already (SkyDrive, in 7 as a pinned IE9 app).  Up to one app has a chance of having a Metro version: Google Chrome (note: Chrome is my base browser, and IE9 is used &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; for SkyDrive.  The Start menu reveals one more: Windows Live Mail (the Mail app reviewed above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metro is written &lt;em&gt;specifically&lt;/em&gt; for tablets.  Pressing the right mouse button to bring up a toolbar is stupid.  This is NOT how a regular user would work.  Same goes for the new lock screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also rated every app.  The ratings will be posted at the end, but now, I’ll share with you that (a) the Metro UI itself got a 3 out of 10, and (b) the Metro apps average for 5.  The highest rating is 10 (Solitaire) and the lowest is 0 (all the apps called &lt;em&gt;useless&lt;/em&gt;: Camera, Xbox Companion, Finance and Remote Desktop).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My opinions are rather negative, I don’t like the new Metro UI, I used a swear word 3 times and censored myself twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="desktop"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Desktop&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/w8cp/img/ss057.png" title="The Desktop." class="fancybox" rel="w8reviewfbox"&gt;&lt;img src="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/w8cp/img/t/ss057.png" alt="The Desktop." title="The Desktop."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The Desktop.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/w8cp/img/ss061.png" title="Windows Explorer with the Ribbon." class="fancybox" rel="w8reviewfbox"&gt;&lt;img src="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/w8cp/img/t/ss061.png" alt="Windows Explorer with the Ribbon." title="Windows Explorer with the Ribbon."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Windows Explorer with the Ribbon.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I left this one for the very end.  I even decided to do this the next day!  First things first, I synced my review data between my PC and my SkyDrive, and then fired up the VM.  Time to click the &lt;strong&gt;Desktop&lt;/strong&gt; tile.  So I hit it and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong style="font-size: 3em;"&gt;START IS GONE! WHAT THE FUCK?!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes.  There is &lt;strong&gt;no Start button&lt;/strong&gt; in Windows 8.  It’s gone forever.  When you hover the bottom left corner, a thing appears, showing your Start screen.  Apparently, hitting this thing will bring the Start screen up.  And, if you right-click in the corner (found this while trying to do anything with that thing), you get a menu with some basic options.  This brings down the rating of the Desktop component of Windows Explorer to 1 out of 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then I fire up the &lt;strong&gt;File Manager component of Windows Explorer.&lt;/strong&gt;  And I am greeted by a Ribbon.  I expressed my opinion about it in my first post about Windows 8, so I’ll quote myself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;strong&gt;Ribbon.&lt;/strong&gt; This has to be the dumbest idea ever. It looks like only 10.9% of commands in Explorer come from the toolbar (or the “command bar”, as called by Steven Sinofsky in the blog post). They also show that, out of the top 10 commands used in Explorer, only two of them are in the toolbar. How would you fix this problem? Either add the commands or just ignore it. But what did Microsoft do? Add a ribbon and put a lot of stuff [on it]. Seriously? This doesn’t fix the problem. People will still work with the context menu and hotkeys. On the plus side, you get two more items in the directory view. Yay! There are also keyboard shortcuts for all the ribbon elements, but they are inputted in a crazy way. 1/10. Yeah, it’s that bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we’ll ignore the 1/10 for a while.  The other things new Explorer brings are mounting VHDs and ISOs and better file copying.  Do like.  How about a 3/10?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wait for a while.  Is that a new window border?  It is.  And it sucks badly.  It lost all of its glass effects, and the buttons are worse.  Everything is square.  It is even worse in the basic theme.  And the visual hint for Show Desktop (the rectangle on the right of 7’s taskbar) is gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/w8cp/img/ss068.png" class="fancybox" rel="w8reviewfbox"&gt;&lt;img src="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/w8cp/img/t/ss068.png" alt="All the apps in Windows 8 (and Cut The Rope)." title="All the apps in Windows 8 (and Cut The Rope)."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;All the apps in Windows 8 (and Cut The Rope).&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back to looking through the apps, even though there is not much to do.  First of, in order to get to your desktop apps, you need to get to the Metro start screen, hit the right menu button in an empty space, hit &lt;em&gt;All apps&lt;/em&gt; on the toolbar and there you go.  You can also type something on the Start screen to search: you are able to search apps, settings, files (it also searches their contents) and Metro apps.  Search can also be brought up through the Charms (right-side toolbar, Windows+C or mouse in top/bottom right corner → mouse going down/up).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll begin with &lt;strong&gt;Internet Explorer 10, Aero Desktop edition&lt;/strong&gt;, as (a) it is pinned on the taskbar; and (b) I am using Word Web App to write this review.  There is only one difference in the UI: the scrollbars are Metro-ish (they aren’t changed in other Aero apps).  The engine may be different, but I didn’t notice any other changes while browsing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up next: &lt;strong&gt;Windows Defender.&lt;/strong&gt; The name is misleading, because it is Microsoft Security Essentials with a different name and integrated into Windows.  And I like MSE, it is my AV on Windows 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not going to review the apps that haven’t been modified, and the only ones that were are On-Screen Keyboard and Task Manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On-Screen Keyboard.&lt;/strong&gt; It looks more like a Metro app, it has a Fade option, and it still can predict input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, the &lt;em&gt;Tablet PC Input Panel&lt;/em&gt; became &lt;em&gt;Touch Keyboard&lt;/em&gt;.  It is really nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Task Manager.&lt;/strong&gt; Oh, this looks familiar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="nofloat unlimitedfigure"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is really basic.  Fortunately, the &lt;em&gt;More details&lt;/em&gt; button brings up something much better, better than Windows 7’s standard Task Manager, more user-friendly than Sysinternals’ Process Explorer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="control-panel"&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Control Panel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/w8cp/img/ss088.png" title="The Control Panel. (glitched, Category view)" class="fancybox" rel="w8reviewfbox"&gt;&lt;img src="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/w8cp/img/t/ss088.png" alt="The Control Panel. (glitched, Category view)" title="The Control Panel. (glitched, Category view)"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;The Control Panel. (glitched, Category view)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also need to take a look at Control Panel.  First thoughts: the icons are corrupted due to its specific way of making the toolbar transparent due to no ribbon here, and when you fire it up from the Explorer, the toolbar is black (and the icons are okay).  Windows Update’s icon is back to normal.  You can see a few new features: Storage Spaces, which let you do magic with HDDs (think: RAID), and a specific Language panel.  But let’s take a closer look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Language.&lt;/strong&gt; MUIs finally stop being a mess: Every user can have his own language, they aren’t in Windows Update anymore, and are not hidden somewhere in Regional settings.  Currently, you cannot get the language packs (even though the ISOs are available in a few languages (creating the language pack shouldn’t be problematic, as it just puts &lt;cite&gt;.mui&lt;/cite&gt; files in C:Windows[languagecode] and other places like that), but this option can also install new keyboard layouts as well.  Good news for the Brits: your very favourite language is on the way to this bloody thing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/w8cp/img/ss095.png" title="Storage Spaces: A configured Storage Space.  Also displaying a *New drive detected* Metro-style notification asking me to **tap** it." class="fancybox" rel="w8reviewfbox"&gt;&lt;img src="http://kwpolska.tk/blog-content/galleries/w8cp/img/t/ss095.png" alt="Storage Spaces: A configured Storage Space.  Also displaying a “New drive detected” Metro-style notification asking me to **tap** it." title="Storage Spaces: A configured Storage Space.  Also displaying a *New drive detected* Metro-style notification asking me to **tap** it."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Storage Spaces: A configured Storage Space.  Also displaying a &lt;em&gt;New drive detected&lt;/em&gt; Metro-style notification asking me to &lt;strong&gt;tap&lt;/strong&gt; it.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storage Spaces.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s something like RAID, only proprietary.  It does it work nicely: it can mirror your drives, and you can have more logical space on your drives.  I also used it to showcase the new copy dialog and the new storage notification, which asks me to &lt;strong&gt;tap&lt;/strong&gt; itself.  If I would disconnect the drive, or if it would fail (in a real machine), my files would be still alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;System.&lt;/strong&gt;  The System window drops the Windows logo, and the Windows Experience Index scale is increased: the upper limit is now 9.9 (Vista had 5.9 and 7 had 7.9).  I get a 2.0 due to using VirtualBox.  Quite frankly, my HDD scored 5.9 in 7, but here it is 6.3.  As far as I know, if I ran 8 without virtualization, I’d get the same scores as in 7.  Weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taskbar.&lt;/strong&gt; They dropped the Start Menu part, they changed the icon, and got rid of the Start Menu tab.  It looks like we won’t see it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Windows 7 File Recovery.&lt;/strong&gt; The name of this applet is a bit weird, as it is Backup and Restore from Windows 7.  I tried to restore my backup from Windows 7 (from yesterday 18:26 CET, they are scheduled for 16:00 CET daily), but it failed for some reason (maybe because the computer name is different?)  By the way: Windows Compressed Folders (the default .zip handler in Windows since 1998) are terrible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think I discovered the reason for the weird name: &lt;strong&gt;File History&lt;/strong&gt;, or, if you’d like, Apple Time Machine rip-off.  It allows me to restore my Windows 8 files easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User Accounts.&lt;/strong&gt; It would be too easy if this OS wouldn’t make me angry today.  It offers me a link stating &lt;em&gt;Make changes to my account in **PC settings**&lt;/em&gt;.  PC settings is the thing that we saw in the &lt;em&gt;What is going on?&lt;/em&gt; chapter (in case you don’t know: this replaced password, user picture and user name options).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JESUS CHRIST!  This thing is evil, evil, evil.  No Start button, no way to skip Metro whatsoever, annoying and annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of ratings, only 7 apps mentioned in this review got scored (the others are the same as 7’s).  Lowest rating belongs to Explorer Desktop (1), highest to Defender/MSE, OSK and Touch Keyboard (8).  The average is 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Review Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Windows 8 apps got an average of 5.24.  But the whole OS would get a 2 out of 10 in terms of UX.  I had no fun while using this system.  It felt like nobody used it with a mouse or keyboard!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I said, I rated everything.  I made it available on Google Docs.  Here it is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;strong style="font-size: 3em;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AjrMNuhf_t4wdHBCRW0tZDVRRnZRaU1SdkVQSXdhVHc&amp;amp;output=html" title="Windows 8 Ratings"&gt;Windows 8 Ratings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also took a lot of screenshots.  Some of them were on the right side, but most aren’t (there are 108 screenshots!).  I saved them for the very end, for the gallery.  Here you go:&lt;/p&gt;

It would be nice to share it on Twitter, Facebook, Google+ or wherever you want.  This post was brought to you by Word Web App.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Windows 8’s New Logo, picture by Microsoft (&lt;a href="http://windowsteamblog.com/windows/b/bloggingwindows/archive/2012/02/17/redesigning-the-windows-logo.aspx"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows has a new logo for a while, therefore, I need to rant about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TEASER_END --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a bit late with it, but that doesn’t matter.  This new logo is the worst thing they could’ve come up with.  It does not retain ANYTHING from the logo style used for the past &lt;strong&gt;twenty-two&lt;/strong&gt; years.  Why does this matter?  It is recogenized everywhere, and brand recognition is very important.  When I see a Windows logo somewhere, I think “This is compatible with Windows or even running Windows itself.”  The color scheme hasn’t been changed since then.  The logo was updated a bit in Windows XP and then a bit more in Vista, but it is still recogenizable.  Now, if you show the new logo (which can be seen at the very top of this post) to somebody, you would get about 0.1% of recogenition around the world — and the people who would do that are the people who saw it somewhere on the Internet (Google returns over 2560 million results).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is just the beginning.  The logo feels Metro-ish and simple.  Too simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more thing.  The logo looks really close to the old Windows 1.0 logo.  Here it is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="nofloat"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the old logo looks good, unlike the new one.  The 1.0 one feels like one big image, and the 8 one feels like the window and the text are separate.  It also shows off the crappiness of Windows 8 itself: it is even less functional than Windows 1.0, which had minimal windowing capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s finish off with an announcement: I’m going to write a review of Windows 8 Consumer Preview as soon as it comes out, as I’ve upgraded my machine a while ago and it is capable of running it nicely, even in VirtualBox.  (for curious people: Athlon II X3 460/GeForce GTS 450/4GB of RAM/500GB of HDD/64-bit Windows 7/64-bit Arch Linux.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update @ 2012-02-26T19:45Z:&lt;/strong&gt; I forgot to mention that it will be released on Wednesday.  Yes, this Wednesday, February the 29th.  Expect the review to show up in the next two weeks (this may be changed at any given moment.  Watch my &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/Kwpolska"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; feed for more news.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>https://chriswarrick.com/pl/blog/2012/02/25/new-windows-logo-yet-another-stupid-idea/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 24 Feb 2012 23:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
