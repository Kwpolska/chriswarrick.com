description: Former bot of Kw, now inexistent.

KwBot was an IRC bot, running on freenode.  It was a supybot.  Its life was long, with many outages, but it died in May 2012 due to no system to run on.  If someone wants to run it on their own server, [contact me][] and I’ll try to help you get up and running.  (note: the last config I have is from 2011 or maybe even 2010.  I didn’t bother backing it up.
