Hello there.  I have a few announcements for you.

First of, I changed the blog engine.  It is now ran by Hyde, a port of Jekyll to Python (but improved).

Second of, all posts from 2009 were archived.  If you are crazy and want to read them, see [Archives/2009][2k9].  They won’t be visible on the Blog page.

Third of, the URLs of posts were changed a bit, but they are fixed by the server.

Fourth of, the Projects page will get a little makeover soon.

That is all.
