## &#8220;Jekyll, Welcome Home.&#8221;, December 12th, 2010  

The Kw&#8217;s Blog was redone. The old blog was run by WordPress, Constructor theme and XHTML posts. Now, I&#8217;m using Jekyll and Markdown posts. That&#8217;s better. All the content was imported and converted to Markdown (except for 3 posts, they are available in HTML forms).  You can see a [comparison of Jekyll and WordPress posts][3]).

And even better: you can see &#8220;this&#8221; instead of &#34;this&#34; (currently only in this post, it will <ins>not</ins> be added into older ones).

## &#8220;OMG I WROTE SOMETHING&#8221;, December 11th, 2010  
This is a jekyll post. *I* can use Markdown. **You** cannot. And for the sake of it, I imported the old blog entries. I had to modify them A LOT. I hope everything will work fine.
