**You probably came here from one of my banners that is telling you about your browser. You are probably wondering: what do I mean by this?**

## A bit of history

**Windows Internet Explorer** (**Microsoft Internet Explorer** before version 7) is a web browser developed by Microsoft, which is a part of Microsoft Windows. It began its life as a part of the paid package *Plus! for Windows 95*, later became free and was included into Windows 95. It was also available for Macintoshes (both the classic and the new ones), HP-UX and Solaris.

## What's wrong about it?

Internet Explorer has many problems. It is [unsafe and insecure][unsafe]. It does not display everything properly - see [Ten Things That Look Wrong in Internet Explorer][10things]. It breaks many [W3C][] Standards.

## How does this affect the blog?

You can't see some CSS features. You shall see my **[CSS 2 vs CSS 3][cssc] comparison**. IE6 cannot render PNG files with alpha transparency properly (I know. There are scripts that can fix it. But the validator isn't happy about them.). And I have to cheat in order to use the `<figure>` HTML5 tag (other semantic tags will be used in future. From the browsers tested by me (Chrome 10, Firefox 3.6, Opera 11.00) only Chrome was able to render my blog with these tags properly.)

## What shall I do?

The best thing to do: get rid of Internet Explorer. Get a modern browser, like Firefox, Chrome (note: use the dev releases), Safari or Opera. Or, if you happen to own Windows Vista or 7, you can get Internet Explorer 9, which is a **good** browser. It supports HTML5 and CSS3.
