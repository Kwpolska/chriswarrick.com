Description: Yapsy is a small library implementing the core mechanisms needed to
        build a plugin system into a wider application.
        
        The main purpose is to depend only on Python's standard libraries (at
        least version 2.3) and to implement only the basic functionalities
        needed to detect, load and keep track of several plugins.
        
        To use yapsy, make sure that the "yapsy" directory is in your Python
        loading path and just import the needed class from yapsy (e.g. "from
        yapsy.PluginManager import PluginManager"). To see more examples, you
        may want to have a look at the unit tests inside the "test" directory.
