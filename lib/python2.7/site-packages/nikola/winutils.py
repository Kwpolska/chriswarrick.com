    Most (all?) of git implementations in windows store a symlink pointing
    into the repo as a text file, the text being the relative path to the
    file with the real content.

    So, in a clone of nikola in windows the symlinked files will have the
    wrong content.

    The linux usage pattern for those files is 'copy to some dir, then use',
    so we inspect after the copy and rewrite the wrong contents.

    The goals are:
       support running nikola from a clone without installing and without
       making dirty the WC.

       support install from the WC.

       if possible and needed, support running the test suite without making
       dirty the WC.
