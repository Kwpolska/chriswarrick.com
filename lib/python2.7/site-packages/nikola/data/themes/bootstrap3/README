A bootstrap3 version of the bootstrap theme.

There is a variant called bootstrap3-gradients which uses an extra 
CSS file for a "improved visual experience". This one uses the
default bootstrap3 flat look.

This theme supports Bootswtach font/color schemes through the 
`nikola bootswatch_theme` command.
