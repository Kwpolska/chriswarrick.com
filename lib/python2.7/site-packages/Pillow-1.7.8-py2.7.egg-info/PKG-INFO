        Pillow
        ======
        
        Pillow is the "friendly" PIL fork. PIL is the Python Imaging Library. Pillow was
        started for and is currently maintained by the Plone community. But it is used by
        many other folks in the Python web community, and probably elsewhere too.
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        The fork author's goal is to foster packaging improvements via:
        
        - Publicized development and solicitation of community support.
        - Exploration of packaging problems within the fork, most noticably
          via adding setuptools support but also via clean up & refactoring
          of packaging code.
        
        Why a fork?
        -----------
        
        PIL is currently not setuptools compatible. Please see
        http://mail.python.org/pipermail/image-sig/2010-August/006480.html for a
        more detailed explanation. Also, PIL's current release/maintenance schedule
        is not compatible with the various & frequent packaging issues that have
        occured.
        
        What about image code bugs?
        ---------------------------
        
        Please report any non-packaging related issues here first:
        
        - https://bitbucket.org/effbot/pil-2009-raclette/issues 
        
        Then open a ticket here:
        
        - https://github.com/python-imaging/Pillow/issues
        
        and provide a link to the first ticket so we can track the issue(s) upstream.
        This project does not aim to fix image code bugs, but if we can track them
        properly we may consider it. (And the image code could potentially be wholesale
        replaced when the next PIL release comes out.)
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        The API documentation included with PIL has been converted (from HTML) to
        reStructured text (via pandoc) and is now `hosted by readthedocs.org`_.

        Python Imaging Library
        ======================
        
        Introduction
        ------------
        
        The Python Imaging Library (PIL) adds image processing capabilities
        to your Python environment.  This library provides extensive file
        format support, an efficient internal representation, and powerful
        image processing capabilities.
        
        This source kit has been built and tested with Python 2.0 and newer,
        on Windows, Mac OS X, and major Unix platforms.  Large parts of the
        library also work on 1.5.2 and 1.6.
        
        The main distribution site for this software is:
        
                http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/
        
        That site also contains information about free and commercial support
        options, PIL add-ons, answers to frequently asked questions, and more.
        
        Development versions (alphas, betas) are available here:
        
                http://effbot.org/downloads/

           +----------------------+---------------------------------------------+
        
           If you have a recent Linux version, the libraries provided with the
           operating system usually work just fine.  If some library is
           missing, installing a prebuilt version (jpeg-devel, zlib-devel,
           etc) is usually easier than building from source.  For example, for
           Ubuntu 9.10 (karmic), you can install the following libraries::
        
               sudo apt-get install libjpeg62-dev
               sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev
               sudo apt-get install libfreetype6-dev
               sudo apt-get install liblcms1-dev
        
           If you're using Mac OS X, you can use the 'fink' tool to install
           missing libraries (also see the Mac OS X section below).
        
           Similar tools are available for many other platforms.
        
        
        2. To build under Python 1.5.2, you need to install the stand-alone
           version of the distutils library:
        
               http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/download.html
        
           You can fetch distutils 1.0.2 from the Python source repository:
           
               svn export http://svn.python.org/projects/python/tags/Distutils-1_0_2/Lib/distutils/
        
           For newer releases, the distutils library is included in the
           Python standard library.
        
           NOTE: Version 1.1.7 is not fully compatible with 1.5.2.  Some
           more recent additions to the library may not work, but the core
           functionality is available.
           
        
        3. If you didn't build Python from sources, make sure you have
           Python's build support files on your machine.  If you've down-
           loaded a prebuilt package (e.g. a Linux RPM), you probably
           need additional developer packages.  Look for packages named
           "python-dev", "python-devel", or similar.  For example, for
           Ubuntu 9.10 (karmic), use the following command:
        
               sudo apt-get install python-dev
        
        
        4. When you have everything you need, unpack the PIL distribution
           (the file Imaging-1.1.7.tar.gz) in a suitable work directory::
        
                $ cd MyExtensions # example
                $ gunzip Imaging-1.1.7.tar.gz
                $ tar xvf Imaging-1.1.7.tar
        
        
        5. Build the library.  We recommend that you do an in-place build,
           and run the self test before installing::
        
                $ cd Imaging-1.1.7
                $ python setup.py build_ext -i
                $ python selftest.py
        
           During the build process, the setup.py will display a summary
           report that lists what external components it found.  The self-
           test will display a similar report, with what external components
           the tests found in the actual build files::
        
                --------------------------------------------------------------------
                Pillow 1.5 ( PIL fork based on PIL 1.1.7 ) SETUP SUMMARY
                --------------------------------------------------------------------
                platform  darwin 2.6.6 (r266:84292, Nov 26 2010, 16:24:16)
                  [GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5664)]
                --------------------------------------------------------------------
                --- TKINTER support available
                --- JPEG support available
                --- ZLIB (PNG/ZIP) support available
                *** FREETYPE2 support not available
                *** LITTLECMS support not available
                --------------------------------------------------------------------
        
           Make sure that the optional components you need are included.
        
           If the build script won't find a given component, you can edit the
           setup.py file and set the appropriate ROOT variable.  For details,
           see instructions in the file.
        
           If the build script finds the component, but the tests cannot
           identify it, try rebuilding *all* modules::
        
                $ python setup.py clean
                $ python setup.py build_ext -i
        
        
        6. If the setup.py and selftest.py commands finish without any
           errors, you're ready to install the library::
        
                $ python setup.py install
        
           (depending on how Python has been installed on your machine,
           you might have to log in as a superuser to run the 'install'
           command, or use the 'sudo' command to run 'install'.)
        
        
        Additional notes for Mac OS X
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        On Mac OS X you will usually install additional software such as
        libjpeg or freetype with the "fink" tool, and then it ends up in
        "/sw".  If you have installed the libraries elsewhere, you may have
        to tweak the "setup.py" file before building.
        
        
        Additional notes for Windows
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        On Windows, you need to tweak the ROOT settings in the "setup.py"
        file, to make it find the external libraries.  See comments in the
        file for details.
        
        Make sure to build PIL and the external libraries with the same
        runtime linking options as was used for the Python interpreter
        (usually /MD, under Visual Studio).
        
        
        Note that most Python distributions for Windows include libraries
        compiled for Microsoft Visual Studio.  You can get the free Express
        edition of Visual Studio from:
        
            http://www.microsoft.com/Express/
        
        To build extensions using other tool chains, see the "Using
        non-Microsoft compilers on Windows" section in the distutils handbook:
        
            http://www.python.org/doc/current/inst/non-ms-compilers.html
        
        For additional information on how to build extensions using the
        popular MinGW compiler, see:
