KwBot is my IRC bot.  It was originally registered on 2010-01-12 on Freenode.

.. TEASER_END

It is currently in its third iteration.  The current iteration is a very basic bot,
written in Twisted.

It lives on Freenode.  You can ``/invite`` it to your channel temporarily, or
`contact me </contact/>`_ to get it permanently.  Demo in ``##kwbot``.

The channels are logged; see logs from ``#nikola`` `generated by KwBot <http://irclogs.getnikola.com/>`_.

Commands must be prepended with ``!`` or ``KwBot: ``.

* ``ping`` — respond with ``pong``
* ``hi`` — respond with ``Hi!``
* ``hello`` — respond with ``Hello!``
* ``help`` — show a message linking to this page
* ``tell target message`` — add the ``message`` to a queue and show it when ``target`` joins the channel next time
