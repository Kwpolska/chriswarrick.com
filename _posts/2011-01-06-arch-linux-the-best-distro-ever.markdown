title: 'Arch Linux: The Best Linux Distro Ever.'
category: gnulinux
---
**I&#8217;m using Linux since 2007. I&#8217;ve been on many distros (in order): [Mandriva][], [Ubuntu][], [openSuSE][], [Fedora][], and only in [VirtualBox][]: [Debian][] and [Linux Mint][]. But since two months there is another distro in both lists (I tested it out on VirtualBox and then set it up on the actual machine): [Arch Linux][].**

Arch Linux is a Linux distribution by Judd Vinet and Aaron Griffin, existing since 2002, intended to be simple, elegant, versatile and expedient (See Reason #3). It uses pacman as the package manager. It&#8217;s a rolling-release distro, that means there are only new CD images released, you get updates even if you&#8217;ve installed Arch Linux v0.1. The current CD release is **2010.05**.

# What makes it so awesome?
There are six things that makes it the best distro:

## Reason 1. [ArchWiki][]
The Arch Wiki is an awesome place. You can find many useful things about Arch. In this article you can find 9 links to articles in the wiki (plus two doubled).

## Reason 2. Pacman and the AUR
The package manager is `pacman`. It has a specific syntax. The [Arch User Repository][AUR] is a place, where you can find PKGBUILDs (build instructions, which help you make a package) for more packages than contents of the default repositioriies - `[core]`, `[extra]` and `[community]` (which consists of binary packages which began their life in AUR) Read the [ArchWiki][] [Pacman][] and [AUR][ArchWiki: AUR] articles for details.

## Reason 3. [The Arch Way][tawv2]
The distro is <q>intended to be simple, elegant, versatile and expedient</q>, as [The Arch Way v2.0][tawv2] states. You can also see [The Arch Way v1.0][tawv1].

## Reason 4. `/etc/rc.conf`
`/etc/rc.conf` is the main configuration file. You can see mine here: [My rc.conf][]

## Reason 5. The community: [IRC][], [Forums][], [Mailing Lists][MLs] and [The Rolling Release e-zine][]
Arch Linux has a strong community: there are many people on the [IRC channel][IRC], [Forums][] and [Mailing Lists][MLs]. They are here to help you.

## Reason 6. The rolling-release model
Arch uses an rolling-release model, described above (and quoted below).

## A short install guide
Visit [Arch Linux Downloads][]. Here you can select a version. You have 6 images available. Netinstall images are small images with the instller files only. Everything else is downloaded from the Internet. Core images are a copy of the core repository from the last release date. Both images come in three architectures: i686, x86-64 and a dual-architecture version.

The installation is easy. Boot the CD, login as root, use the `km` command if not using an US keyboard and then run the installer by using the `/arch/setup` command. More installation help is available in the [Official Arch Linux Install Guide][]. Another useful document is the [Beginners&#8217; Guide][beginners guide].
