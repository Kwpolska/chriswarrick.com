**The blog is now available in Polish in an open beta. You can test it here: <http://kwpolska.co.cc/polish/>.**

Why am I doing that? I want to make it readable for Poles who don't know English. My blog was rejected from a contest because of English content.

This is not the first time when I’m making a bilingual blog. Old KwPortal “blog” was also bilingual, but it looked like this:

> This is some random KwPortal post.
> <hr>
> To jest dowolny post w KwPortalu.
{% bilingual %}
