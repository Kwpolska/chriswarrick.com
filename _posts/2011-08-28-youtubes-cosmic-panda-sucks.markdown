title: YouTube’s Cosmic Panda Sucks.

**I played with the YouTube’s Cosmic Panda UI for a while.  I am not happy
about it.**

YouTube has a new experiment: [Cosmic Panda][cphelp].  They test new
channel and watch page experiences.  I’m opting out — here’s why.

# Watch Page

Let’s try watching a video, pretty much anything would work.  The [opt-in
page][cppage] suggest [Nyan Cat][nyan], so let’s watch it.

Some things don’t work well, though:

 1. Flash Player hides controls when playing
 2. Video Size:

    1. Doesn’t adjust the size of the current video, but adjusts
       the next ones you choose
    2. Makes it impossible to use controls in mode 4 (window size)

 3. Thumbnails on the right don’t open in a new tab when clicked with the
    mouse wheel
 4. Comments:

    1. Some avatars don’t show up
    2. The dislike button was hidden when the project started

That’s all I can see, but I guess there are more flaws.

# Playlist Watch Page

YouTube suggests [a playlist of Rickrolls][rr].  Great.  Or not.  The UI has
more flaws!

The flaws?  I’m sure about two: you can’t stop the playlist from advancing
to the next video and the content is not organized nicely.  Take a look at
the image above.  Blue = playlist content.  Red = video content.  That’s a
total mess!  Did they do any usability tests?  I don’t think so.  The “old”
YouTube, for comparison, has a bottom panel with all playlist videos.
Everything else belongs to the video.  Readable and human-friendly.

<aside style="width: 110px;"><div class="legend"><div class="legendbox" style="background-color: #00f;">1</div> playlist content<br><div class="legendbox" style="background-color: #f00;">2</div> video content</div></div></aside>

# Channels

I almost forgot about channel view.  This time I will advertise and jump to
[Kikoskia’s Channel][kiko] (sorry for covering the background on screens).

In case you’re wondering, the Videos tab shows playlists and the Community
tab shows new videos, channel comments, etc.  There is one problem: every
video link sends you to a playlist.  In order to get out of the playlist,
you need to modify the URL.  It would be great if I could see the channel
background.

**YouTube, remove these not-so-great fetures NOW.**
