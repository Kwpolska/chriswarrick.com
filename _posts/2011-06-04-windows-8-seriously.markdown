**Windows 8 is being made.  Unfortunately, it kinda sucks.**
<!--more-->
Microsoft posted an article titled *[Previewing ‘Windows 8’][msart]*.  They
have some useless text and a [demo video][msvid].  It explains how it will
work.  Windows 8 is touch-centric.  The main UI is the [Metro UI][metro].
The whole UI concept developed since Windows 95 was scrapped.
