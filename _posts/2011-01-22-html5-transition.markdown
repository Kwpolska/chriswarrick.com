Recently, the [HTML5 logo][] was published. As W3C states, <q> [i]t stands strong and true, resilient and universal as the markup you write. [...] And it certainly doesn't use tables for layout.</q> The logoâ€™s site presents you with many information about HTML5, the new possibilities and the new logo. Due to that, I decided to make use of HTML5. Right now, the blog is using the HTML5 semantics (header, footer, nav, article) and CSS3 (border-radius). <del>The CSS3 part is still in development.</del>

<ins>Update: The CSS3 part is ready.</ins>
