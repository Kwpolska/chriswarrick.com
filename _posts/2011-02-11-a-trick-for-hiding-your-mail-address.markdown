title: A Trick For Hiding Your Mail Address
category: webmastering

Recently, [Aza Raskin published a blog post about protecting your mail address with CSS][raskin]. He uses some random CSS to make “randomness” look like “racmnFudZG9otbmmVnzcewsos” when you copy it. That’s nice, but I found a better way — the [Kw’s Mail Hide Trick][kw]. See it for yourself.

*[racmnFudZG9otbmmVnzcewsos]: I merged the word with itself in base64.
