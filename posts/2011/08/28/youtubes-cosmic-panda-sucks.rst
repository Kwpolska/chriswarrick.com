I played with the YouTube’s Cosmic Panda UI for a while.  I am not happy
about it.

.. TEASER_END

YouTube has a new experiment: Cosmic Panda.  They test new
channel and watch page experiences.  I’m opting out — here’s why.

Watch Page
==========

.. raw:: html

    <figure class="pull-right" style="width: 110px;"><a href="/blog-content/galleries/cosmicpanda/nyancat.png"><img src="/blog-content/galleries/cosmicpanda/t/nyancat.png"><figcaption>Nyan Cat — Cosmic Panda</figcaption></a></figure>

Let’s try watching a video, pretty much anything would work.  The opt-in
page suggests `Nyan Cat`_, so let’s watch it.


Some things don’t work well, though:

1. Flash Player hides controls when playing
2. Video Size:

   1. Doesn’t adjust the size of the current video, but adjusts
      the next ones you choose
   2. Makes it impossible to use controls in mode 4 (window size)

3. Thumbnails on the right don’t open in a new tab when clicked with the
   mouse wheel
4. Comments:

   1. Some avatars don’t show up
   2. The dislike button was hidden when the project started

That’s all I can see, but I guess there are more flaws.

Playlist Watch Page
===================

YouTube suggests `a playlist of Rickrolls`_.  Great.  Or not.  The UI has
more flaws!

.. raw:: html

    <figure class="pull-right" style="width: 110px;"><a href="/blog-content/galleries/cosmicpanda/rickroll.png"><img src="/blog-content/galleries/cosmicpanda/t/rickroll.png"><figcaption>Rickroll collection/Rick Roll x100 — Cosmic Panda</figcaption></a></figure>

The flaws?  I’m sure about two: you can’t stop the playlist from advancing
to the next video and the content is not organized nicely.  Take a look at
the image #2.  Blue = playlist content.  Red = video content.  That’s a
total mess!  Did they do any usability tests?  I don’t think so.  The “old”
YouTube, for comparison, has a bottom panel with all playlist videos.
Everything else belongs to the video.  Readable and human-friendly.

Channels
========

.. raw:: html

    <figure class="pull-right" style="width: 110px;"><a href="/blog-content/galleries/cosmicpanda/kiko.png"><img src="/blog-content/galleries/cosmicpanda/t/kiko.png"><figcaption>Kikoskia’s Channel — Cosmic Panda</figcaption></a></figure>

I almost forgot about channel view.  This time I will advertise and jump to
`Kikoskia’s Channel`_ (sorry for covering the background on screens).

In case you’re wondering, the Videos tab shows playlists and the Community
tab shows new videos, channel comments, etc.  There is one problem: every
video link sends you to a playlist.  In order to get out of the playlist,
you need to modify the URL.  It would be great if I could see the channel
background.

**YouTube, remove these not-so-great fetures NOW.**
