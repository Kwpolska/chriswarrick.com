.. nocomments: true

I’m using Linux since 2007. I’ve been on many distros (in order): `Mandriva`_, `Ubuntu`_, `openSuSE`_, `Fedora`_, and only in `VirtualBox`_: `Debian`_ and `Linux Mint`_. But since two months there is another distro in both lists (I tested it out on VirtualBox and then set it up on the actual machine): `Arch Linux`_.

.. _Ubuntu:     http://ubuntu.com
.. _openSuSE:   http://opensuse.org

.. TEASER_END

Arch Linux is a Linux distribution by Judd Vinet and Aaron Griffin, existing since 2002, intended to be simple, elegant, versatile and expedient (See Reason #3). It uses pacman as the package manager. It’s a rolling-release distro, that means there are only new CD images released, you get updates even if you’ve installed Arch Linux v0.1.

What makes it so awesome?
-------------------------
There are six things that makes it the best distro:

Reason 1. ArchWiki_
-------------------
The Arch Wiki is an awesome place. You can find many useful things about Arch. In this article you can find 9 links to articles in the wiki (plus two doubled).

## Reason 2. Pacman and the AUR
The package manager is ``pacman``. It has a specific syntax. The `Arch User Repository`_ is a place, where you can find PKGBUILDs (build instructions, which help you make a package) for more packages than contents of the default repositioriies — ``[core]``, ``[extra]`` and ``[community]`` (which consists of binary packages that began their life in AUR) Read the ArchWiki_ Pacman_ and `AUR`_ articles for details.

Reason 3. `The Arch Way`_
-------------------------
The distro is *intended to be simple, elegant, versatile and expedient*, as `The Arch Way`_ v2.0 states.

Reason 4. ``/etc/rc.conf``
--------------------------
``/etc/rc.conf`` is the main configuration file. **Or at least it was when I
wrote this post.**

**systemd** replaced it.  And boy is it awesome.  It’s much more friendly than
``/etc/rc.conf`` ever was.

Reason 5. The community: IRC_, Forums_, `Mailing Lists`_
--------------------------------------------------------

Arch Linux has a strong community: there are many people on the IRC_ channel, Forums_ and `Mailing Lists`_. They are here to help you.

Reason 6. The rolling-release model
-----------------------------------

Arch uses an rolling-release model: there are only new CD images released, and you get updates even if you’ve installed Arch Linux v0.1.
