    Recently, the <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/logo">HTML5 logo</a> was published. As W3C states, <emph>[i]t stands strong and true, resilient and universal as the markup you write. [...] And it certainly doesn't use tables for layout.</emph> The logoâ€™s site presents you with many information about HTML5, the new possibilities and the new logo. Due to that, I decided to make use of HTML5. Right now, the blog is using the HTML5 semantics and CSS3.
