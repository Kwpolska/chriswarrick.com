.. description: A trick for hiding your mail address.

Recently, `Aza Raskin`_ published a blog post about protecting your mail address
with CSS. He uses some random CSS to make “randomness” look like
“racmnFudZG9otbmmVnzcewsos” when you copy it. That’s nice, but I found a better
way — the Kw’s Mail Hide Trick. See it for yourself, after the break.

It was css ``content: 'mail@address.com'``, but isn’t anymore.
