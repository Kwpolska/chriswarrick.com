.. description: I changed the blog engine AGAIN.

**Update 2013-02-07: Now running Nikola.**

Hello there.  I have a few announcements for you.

First off, I changed the blog engine.  It is now ran by Hyde, a port of Jekyll to Python (but improved).

Second off, all posts from 2009 were archived.  If you are crazy and want to read them, see `2009 Archives </blog/2009/>`_.  They won’t be visible on the Blog page.

Third off, the URLs of posts were changed a bit, but they are fixed by the server.

Fourth off, the Projects page will get a little makeover soon.

That is all.

.. TEASER_END
