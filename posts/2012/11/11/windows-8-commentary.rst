.. description: A commentary this time.

Windows 8 was released on 2012-10-26.  That is, 16 days ago.  Why am I writing
about it now?  Easy: because I did not even bother doing a review.  This is
just a bit of quick commentary.

.. TEASER_END

I used Windows 8 for a bit since the RTM, thanks to the 90-day evaluation.
And?  Not too much has changed since Release Preview.  It lost even more Aero.
Other little changes appeared.  That’s it.

I tested the new system on some humans.  They didn’t quite like and understand
the new stuff.  So, not good.

And also, there are TV ads and other marketing materials.  Can you please guess
what is used to control the system in them?  That’s right: touch.  They also
recommend new PCs.  Most of them are the ones I like to call “hipster”:
ultrabooks, all-in-ones, tablets, convertibles.  Oh well.  Because everybody
wants to buy a brand new PC now.  Tell you what: most people don’t.  Unlike eg.
smartphones, people generally buy new PCs when their old ones are (a) broken;
(b) painfully slow; (c) old as hell.  So we have that.

That $40 upgrades are a way to get more people to use Windows 8.  They did it,
because they know that they might not get a lot of upgrades if it was more
expensive.  Another possible explanation is the fact that it may not be liked
by people.  The cheaper the product, the more likely are people to buy it
impulsively.

That concludes my thoughts for now.  I will publish more of them when sales
reports will be published.

Bonus: `Get to know Windows`_
=============================

Click on the section title.  Go ahead.  I suggest a {Ctrl,Cmd}-click.  It goes
over to Microsoft.com.  Now, why you need to go to Microsoft.com to learn this?
Why isn’t this shown at the first login to Windows?  Or at least a “Hello, you
may want to learn what we will fuck you with for the next three or so years
unless you decide to downgrade, but we all know that you won’t, right?
Right?  **Learn more** pop-up.  So, *Overview* and *Search, share, &
more* teach you the basics of Metro.  All fine.  Now, let’s learn what changed.
I replaced marketing bullshit with the word *blah*.  Everything that I said is
in *italics*.

Using Windows
-------------

Search.
  *blah blah blah* Charms *blah blah blah* apps
Start.
  *blah blah blah* replaced by Start *blah* home base *blah* open
  apps *blah* glance at the tiles *blah* how to get there
Desktop.
  *blah* Desktop tile *blah* Win+D
Open Control Panel.
  *blah* Control Panel *blah* PC settings *blah* searching *blah* Settings
  charm
Help and Support.
  *blah* Search *blah* Settings→Help on Start *blah blah* Settings→Help in apps
  or *blah blah blah* else *blah blah*
Turn off or shut down a PC.
  *Oh, hi.  It’s you.  So, how are you holding up, shutdown magic?  Let’s
  read about you.* *blah blah* no need to shut down *blah* sleep *blah*
  little power, faster startup, back to where you left off*—what?  So you
  want people to put Windows to sleep now?  This capability is in Windows
  since ages.  Congrats, Microsoft, on reminding yourself of its existence
  and thus getting to tell people to do it the proper way!  Unless you use a
  desktop PC, where it is almost always better to do a full halt.* *blah*
  default mode *blah* close your lid or hit the power button *blah* *Hold on.
  You want me to hit the power button?  I enabled this fancy
  start-up-at-the-moment-in-which-you-get-power feature for <strong>a
  reason.</strong>  Getting to the power button of my tower is not that easy.
  I don’t want to duck so low. *  *blah* change default mode to sleep *why
  isn’t the it default?* *blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah* airplane
  *blah* not using *blah* turn off *blah*close desktop apps blah save work
  *blah* settings charm *blah* power *blah* shut down *blah*.  </dl>

Using apps
----------

Print.
  Devices charm or Ctrl+P *blah blah blah* no support *blah* add
See all apps (programs). *Oh, back to the “programs” word?  What for?*
  *blah* All apps *blah* keyboard search *blah*
Install apps.
  *blah* Store *blah* media *blah* DVD *blah* Internet *blah blah*
Microsoft account
   Add an account to an app. *WTF?* *blah* create account if none *blah* Settings→Accounts in app *blah* Add *blah blah* type *blah blah* instructions.
Close an app.
  Apps *blah blah* from the Windows Store don’t slow down your PC, so you
  don’t need to close them *blah blah* close at random *blah* close desktop
  apps before shutodwn *blah* drag from the top of the screen to the bottom
  *BTW: why, exactly, this way? blah* *blah* left-side menu *blah* drag to
  bottom with touch, right-click and Close with a mouse *blah*

So we have that.  Up next, Customize Start.  Standard.  How to use apps, or:
app commands (right-click/{↓,↑}swipe).  Those things are important, but are
also easily discoverable by mistake.  Switch between apps?  Standard
swipe-from-left/top-left corner thing, not so easy to find.  Also, app
snapping.

**So, I still hate Windows 8.  And will hate it forever.**
