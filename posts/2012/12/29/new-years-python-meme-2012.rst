Here it comes:

**1. What’s the coolest Python application, framework or library you have
discovered in 2012?**

A lot of them.  Requests_ by the ever-awesome Kenneth Reitz, for example.


**2. What new programming technique did you learn in 2012?**

Python and Pythonic code is the answer for this one.  I fell in love with
Python really quickly.  For a reason.

**3. Which open source project did you contribute to the most in 2012? What
did you do?**

Mine don’t count, right?  If yes, then it would be Aura_ and its pl_PL
translation, but it is not Python.  (BTW, if anyone is looking for some pl_PL
translations for their project using GNU gettext, drop me a line.)

**4. Which Python blog or website did you read the most in 2012?**

docs.python.org.  Also, Planet Python is providing me with a lot of news and
such.  I also have some other blogs in my RSS.

**5. What are the three top things you want to learn in 2013?**

Python: web development, wxPython (Py{Qt4,Side} now, but wxWidgets is
multi-platform and I might try it), databases.

Non-Python: LaTeX and probably a few other things.

**6. What is the top software, application or library you wish someone would
write in 2013?**

A me-friendly Todo list (I am going to take care of this soon, with wxWidgets
and GAE), but that is barely important.  Because nobody fits my needs in terms
of accessibility and such.  Actually, I have a bit of spare time now and may as
well devote it to doing that.  Remember question 5?  Web development → I want
it to run on GAE or Heroku (more likely, Heroku), free for everyone.  wxPython
→ multi-platform GUI.  Databases → storing the TODOs.  LaTeX?  Personal use.

Want to do your own list?  Here’s how:

1. copy-paste the questions and answer to them in your blog
2. tweet it with the `#2012pythonmeme <https://twitter.com/search/realtime?q=%232012pythonmeme>`_ hashtag
