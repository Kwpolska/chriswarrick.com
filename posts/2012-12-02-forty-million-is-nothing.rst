.. description: 40 million, you say?  After a month?  HAH.

I’ve been busy, but I now have time to write about it: in a bit over one month,
Microsoft sold **40,000,000** licenses of Microsoft Windows.  That is a little
bit above, hmm, nothing.

.. TEASER_END

`Obligatory Microsoft link`_.  But, oh wait, there is one important word:
*licenses*.  So, when [insert favorite OEM here] called Microsoft and said he
wants eg. 10000 OEM licenses for his new PCs.  The counter goes up by 10000 the
moment *Microsoft* gets their money for the license, and not when the OEM gets
their money for a sold machine.

We have sorted out the OEM thing.  But how does this number relate to
BOX/Upgrade purchases?  Activations or shipments?  That is also important.  And
that is how you go from 10 million to 40 million. without actually selling that
many copies.

And now, let’s talk a bit about the NPD.  And I mean the US market reasearcher
and `what they wrote about Windows 8`_. What did they write, may you ask?  8
(and PCs themselves) did not do well.  Great news for sane people!
Unfortunately, it was just one month.  Including Black Friday, though.  And I
hope Windows 8 will die horribly.  And quickly.  Same goes for Microsoft.
Because people do not want Modern UI (aka Metro).  And Windows tablets.  Now go
buy an iPad.  Or a Mac.  Or both.  Or a Windows 7 PC.  Or a clean PC on which
you can install Linux, and preferrably a good distro of it.
