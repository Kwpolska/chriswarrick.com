On Monday, Apple announced some changes to its Mac lineup. All MacBooks (even
the Air) got CPU upgrades, and the starting price of a MacBook Pro (13″, no
Touch Bar) went down to US$1299. Which makes the 12-inch model effectively
pointless.

A quick spec comparison reveals that the Pro comes with a much better CPU, GPU,
screen, camera — the only drawback is the storage space.

If you look at the cheapest MacBook in each category, you end up with this:

* 13″ Air, $999
* 12″, **$1299**
* 13″ Pro, **$1299**
* 13″ Pro with Touch Bar, $1799
* 15″ Pro with Touch Bar, $1299

Yes, this is correct: a 12″ MacBook costs the same as a 13″ Pro. But is it really true? Let's compare the specs:

For $0 extra, you can get a device with a **much** better CPU, 2 Thunderbolt 3 ports, a (slightly) larger screen, a better front-facing camera, support for larger/more displays. The “price” for this? Only less storage space, 0.45 kg (roughly 1 lb) of weight. And no gold color options.

To me, this screams “don’t buy the 12-inch thing” — you can get much more *computer* for the same price. And the CPUs in those computers are pretty poor. Last year’s base model is beaten in `benchmarks <https://browser.primatelabs.com/mac-benchmarks>`_ by much older (and cheaper) machines, eg. 2014’s MacBook Air, 11″ base model in single-core benchmarks and upgraded 2015 Airs in multi-core benchmarks.

And even if you don’t care about the CPU, there are also other things, like the better camera, or two ports that support more devices. If you want a computer that lets you stay productive, and want a Mac, don’t even try buying the 12″ MacBook **Abomination**.
