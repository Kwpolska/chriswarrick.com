<p>On Monday, Apple announced some changes to its Mac lineup. All MacBooks (even
the Air) got CPU upgrades, and the starting price of a MacBook Pro (13″, no
Touch Bar) went down to US$1299. Which makes the 12-inch model effectively
pointless.</p>
<p>A quick spec comparison reveals that the Pro comes with a much better CPU, GPU,
screen, camera — the only drawback is the storage space.</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->
<p>If you look at the cheapest MacBook in each category, you end up with this:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>13″ Air, $999</p></li>
<li><p>12″, <strong>$1299</strong></p></li>
<li><p>13″ Pro, <strong>$1299</strong></p></li>
<li><p>13″ Pro with Touch Bar, $1799</p></li>
<li><p>15″ Pro with Touch Bar, $1299</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, this is correct: a 12″ MacBook costs the same as a 13″ Pro. But is it really true? Let's compare the specs:</p>

<p>For $0 extra, you can get a device with a <strong>much</strong> better CPU, 2 Thunderbolt 3 ports, a (slightly) larger screen, a better front-facing camera, support for larger/more displays. The “price” for this? Only less storage space, 0.45 kg (roughly 1 lb) of weight. And no gold color options.</p>
<p>To me, this screams “don’t buy the 12-inch thing” — you can get much more <em>computer</em> for the same price. And the CPUs in those computers are pretty poor. Last year’s base model is beaten in <a class="reference external" href="https://browser.primatelabs.com/mac-benchmarks">benchmarks</a> by much older (and cheaper) machines, eg. 2014’s MacBook Air, 11″ base model in single-core benchmarks and upgraded 2015 Airs in multi-core benchmarks.</p>
<p>And even if you don’t care about the CPU, there are also other things, like the better camera, or two ports that support more devices. If you want a computer that lets you stay productive, and want a Mac, don’t even try buying the 12″ MacBook <strong>Abomination</strong>.</p>
