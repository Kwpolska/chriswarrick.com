Former contents:

The blog is now available in Polish in an open beta. You can test it here: <http://kwpolska.tk/polish/>.

Why am I doing that? I want to make it readable for Poles who don't know English. My blog was rejected from a contest because of English content.

This is not the first time when I’m writing a bilingual blog. Old KwPortal “blog” was also bilingual, but it looked like this:

.. raw:: html

    <blockquote>
    This is some random KwPortal post.
    <hr>
    To jest dowolny post w KwPortalu.
    </blockquote>
