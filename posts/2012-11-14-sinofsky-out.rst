.. description: Steven Sinofsky is out of Microsoft!

Steven Sinofsky said goodbye to Microsoft on `Monday`_.  Who is he,
may you ask?  The guy that provided us with entertainment for the last
few months here.  He was responsible for creating this beautiful piece
of shit that is Windows 8.  So, he fucked shit up and quit.
Marvellous.

So, bye Steve, and have fun fucking shit up somewhere else.  Maybe
Schei√üung, um, Samsung?
