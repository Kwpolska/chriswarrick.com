.. type: text

I recently switched distros on my server, from Debian to Fedora, to use
``systemd`` and keep it in line with my home `Arch Linux`_ system (which was
not reinstalled since 2010, by the way!)  Why is systemd so awesome?  Read
on to find out.

.. TEASER_END


*(I changed the hardware for my home system along the way.  And just copied
everything over with ``dd``.  That’s Linux at its finest.)*

User friendly
=============

The most important thing in systemd is its user friendliness.  systemd offers
the ``systemctl`` tool, which can be used to control all the services.  You
can see what exactly is going on: what is running, what failed to start,
and you can also see why if you ask ``systemctl status $SERVICE``.

Services
========

Writing services is fun
-----------------------

If you want your own services, you just need to write some simple INI files.  No
need for bash, distro-specific frameworks and whatnot.  If I have a functioning
service written on Arch, I can just copy the file over to Fedora and blindly
enable it — assuming I have the executables installed, it’s guaranteed to work.

And the units are tiny::

    fedora$ wc -l /usr/lib/systemd/system/nginx.service
    15 /usr/lib/systemd/system/nginx.service
    debian$ wc -l /etc/init.d/nginx
    101 /etc/init.d/nginx

And you can write a bare-minimum systemd daemon in less than that – not so easy
with ``sysvinit`` (writing everything on one line doesn’t count!)

Managing personal services
--------------------------

systemd also features user-specific services.  You can run any service as your
user.  I use this to run KwBot_, which was previously under control of
``supervisord`` — that’s one less dependency to care about!

.. _KwBot: /kwbot/

Runlevels do not exist
----------------------

systemd does away with the standard convention of runlevels.  They are replaced
by human-friendly *targets*.  Each unit defines its target: most use
``multi-user.target``.  It is much easier to manage.

No symlink mess
---------------

Just like old sysvinit-esque systems, systemd uses symlinks to manage
enabled/disabled services.  There is just one difference: you get just **one**
symlink in the appropriate ``.wants`` directory.  You do not have to look into
all the different runlevels.  ``graphical.target`` depends on
``multi-user.target``, which in turn depends on ``basic.target``, which depends
on a few more targets required to get the system up and running.

Units can depend on each other
------------------------------

Do you have some units that require the network to be up?  Set it to be run
after and require ``network.target`` and call it a day.

The Journal
===========

If I want to know what is going on in my system, I can just ask ``journalctl``
to show me the most recent messages.  I don’t need to read a thousand different
log files — most things appear in the journal.  Sure, some things aren’t there
(yet), but what I *can* see is very useful.

Did I really change my distro for all that?
===========================================

Yes.  I got too annoyed with Debian’s idiocy.  Also, DigitalOcean doesn’t
*really* support Debian testing, and I cannot survive with outdated software.
I feel much better and, more importantly, **safer** with Fedora.

(also, the “Veteran Unix Admins” of Devuan are a bunch of idiots.)
