<p>A week ago, I was inspired to produce a new <a class="reference external" href="/projects/">projects page</a> for
myself.  The previous one was a trainwreck with a lot of hacks.  Also hosted on
GitHub Pages for some reason.</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->
<p>So, considering I’m so invested in <a class="reference external" href="https://getnikola.com/">Nikola</a> already,
I produced the <a class="reference external" href="http://plugins.getnikola.com/#projectpages">projectpages plugin</a>
and also made it publicly available.  The plugin produces two files,
<code class="docutils literal">projects/index.html</code> and <code class="docutils literal">projects/projects.json</code>, and also enforces a
specific framework for the stories used for the individual projects, because
all the metadata are taken from special meta fields.</p>
<p>In Nikola, post metadata is completely arbitrary (in fact, that’s my fault; I
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/getnikola/nikola/pull/304">contributed the feature</a> back in February 2013).
You can put anything you want, and Nikola will let any plugin and template use the information in any way it likes.</p>
<p>And that is basically the gist of the projectpages plugin.  Using some specific
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/getnikola/plugins/tree/master/v7/projectpages#meta-fields">meta fields</a>,
the plugin produces all the files.  It also provides ready-made templates for
the story pages (though the default templates are designed to fit my site
only).</p>
<p>This plugin is basically a special index page generator.  It takes all the
stories in the designated projects directory, looks at the metadata, and
lists them in a nice format (slider of featured projects + a list of everything
else that is not hidden).  Everything automated and done for you, as is always
with Nikola — which values simplicity and ease of use.</p>
<p><strong>The result:</strong> a pretty <strong><a href="/projects/">projects page</a></strong>.  And some good OSS work done.</p><p>PS. I just underwent a move to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a>
and I love them.  Moreover, this blog is proudly <em>HTTPS only</em> as of yesterday.</p>
