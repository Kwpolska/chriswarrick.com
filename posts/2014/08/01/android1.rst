I recently got a brand new smartphone.  I had — pretty much — the world’s worst
Android phone before.  The new phone is much more up-to-date and modern.  How
bad was its predecessor?  Well, I’ll be happy to tell you!

In a |s| series.  Haven’t done a series since 2010 (and I trashed that one).  I also
haven’t blogged in Polish for quite long (since 2011, to be precise).  This is
a change in both regards.

There is currently no schedule (and no finalized content), but the posts in the
series are:

1. Speeker — or, a little Android app
2. The Four Pieces of Android, or why is it so fragmented
3. The Andro-Cheapo-Phone
4. “A *<manufacturer>* *<model>*, Subsidized by *<carrier>*\”
5. TouchWiz makes no Sense: why OEM skins are evil
6. One System Fits All: Scaling in Android

*The list of posts might be extended.*
