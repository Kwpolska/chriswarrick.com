`Time management <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management>`_ is hard.
The best way to do it is to have a task list, also known as a `to-do list
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#Implementation_of_goals>`_.
And the best tool?  Pen and paper.  Yes, analog pen and analog paper.

.. TEASER_END

However, it should not be your regular analog piece of paper.  What I do
instead is printing out a nice template.  A template crafted in
LaTeX, which is the best typesetting system for technical stuff
and technical people.

The goal of the project is to make a human-friendly, usable todo-list
templates to be used.  The templates can also be filled in by
LaTeX itself, if you want and feel like installing a
LaTeX compiler (XeLaTeX to be precise) — for all the other
people, an empty template is available.
