Here it comes:

**1. What’s the coolest Python application, framework or library you
discovered this year?**

`Nikola`_.

.. _Nikola: http://getnikola.com/

**2. What new programming technique did you learn this year?**

There are lots of them, including writing sane context managers.

**3. Which open source project did you contribute to the most this year? What
did you do?**

`Nikola`_ yet again!  Up until now, I made 484 commits (or 431
excluding merge commits) — which is quite a lot.

**4. Which Python blogs, websites or mailing lists did you read the most this year?**

`Ned Batchelder’s`_ and `Armin Ronacher’s`_ blogs and many things that are on Planet Python.

**5. What are the three top things you want to learn next year?**

There are lots of them, mainly C, some Ruby and JavaScript.

**6. What is the top software, application or library you wish someone would
write next year?**

My current todo-list says it all — and I’m working on that:

* A quick app for CSV display
* A GitHub Releases API client
* ``nap`` = ``sleep`` + progressbar (`almost-done-thing on GitHub <https://github.com/Kwpolska/nap>`_ — C)
* River of Text — Python CLI library (`skeleton on GitHub <https://github.com/Kwpolska/rot>`_)
