Coil CMS is a user-friendly CMS frontend for `Nikola <../nikola/>`_ — a static site and blog generator, written in Python.

Coil CMS can lower the barrier to entry for people wanting to write posts: with
Coil, users do not need to know any markup languages (it comes with a WYSIWYG
editor), Unix and don’t even need to know what a *static site generator* is.
They can just write and hit *Rebuild*, and everything will be taken care of for
them by Coil CMS.

Coil CMS is using the Flask framework and heavily depends on parts of the
Nikola codebase.  It offers a friendly user interface and the same care and
attention to detail Nikola users are accustomed to.
