``upass`` is an interface to `pass <http://www.passwordstore.org/>`_, the standard Unix password manager.

``upass`` is using urwid, which means it has a friendly full-screen console
interface.  It shows your directory structure (with flattened subdirectories)
and calls ``pass`` when requested.  (It does not use ``pass -c`` due to
subprocessing issues, instead opting for a manual copy â€” note that the
clipboard **will not be cleared**).

If you want to see how it looks, check out `the screenshots gallery </galleries/upass/>`_.

``upass`` is under development (and was initially written in one evening).  If you have
ideas, bugs, or want to help, hop over to the `GitHub page <https://github.com/Kwpolska/upass>`_.

You can install ``upass`` from `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/upass>`_ (with ``pip install upass``). Arch Linux
users can install the ``upass`` package from the AUR.
