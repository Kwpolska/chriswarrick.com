This is a simple Android app for Text-to-Speech. It uses the default system voice.

 Speeker is a very small and easy frontend to the system TTS service.  In its
 current iteration, it’s quite limited. The complete feature set is:

 * speak text provided by the user
 * speak text in the system default TTS language (as set in Android settings,
   and there is currently no button to even get you there)
 * clear the text box
 * display About screen
 * display open source licenses
 * open my website

 That’s SIX features!  And you can’t even download it from Google Play, because
 I’m too cheap to pay the $25 fee!
