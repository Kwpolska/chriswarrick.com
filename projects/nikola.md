Nikola is a static site and blog generator, written in Python.  It can
use Mako and Jinja2 templates, and input in many popular markup
formats, such as reStructuredText and Markdown — and can even turn
Jupyter Notebooks into blog posts! It also supports image galleries,
and is multilingual.  Nikola is flexible, and page builds are
extremely fast, courtesy of doit (which is rebuilding only what has
been changed).

Unlike many other generators, Nikola comes with *batteries included* and offers
many features out of the box, making it easy to create a modern website.

I am a co-maintainer of Nikola, responsible for a sizeable fraction of commits
— but I am not the one who did the most work and came up with the idea (it was
[Roberto Alsina](http://ralsina.me/)).

This website used to be powered by Nikola between 2013 and 2026. This blog is now using
my own static site generator, unoriginally named [Yet Another Blog Generator](../yabg/).
