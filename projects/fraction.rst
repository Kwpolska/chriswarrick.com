A simple implementation of fractions, used to learn OOP in Java and C++.

The Fraction class supports:

* addition, subtraction, multiplication and division (via methods in Java and operator overloading in C++)
* simplification (2/4 -> 1/2)
* mixed numbers (eg. 5/2 == 2 1/2)

The Fraction class currently does not support:

* comparisons
* unit testing

The Fraction class was written in Java first and then rewritten in C++. It was
a learning exercise to understand how to write object-oriented code in those
two languages.

The class is documented in Javadoc and Doxygen (but the docs are not shipped as
of now).
