PKGBUILDer.  A Python AUR helper/library.
=========================================

PURPOSE
-------
Building and installing AUR packages.

INSTALLATION
------------
Copy pkgbuilder.py to /usr/bin or ~/bin.  You need to install
pyalpm from [extra] and python3-aur from the AUR.

NOTES
-----
This is Version 2 of PKGBUILDer.  The original Perl version is included,
but it shall not be used.

Version 2.1 is a big leap forward.  It introduces many new features.
It is now stable.  It is now available as an AUR and PyPI package.

The -S (DS.pacman) parameter adds pacman wrapper compatibility.

For more info, refer to the pkgbuilder(8) man page or HTML docs in
docs/html.
