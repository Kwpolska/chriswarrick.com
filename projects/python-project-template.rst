A template for Python projects.  It makes it easy to create new Python
projects, with just a few replacements required.  Many things are already
there, already prepared for you.

Contents
========

The template contains the following files to get you started:

* pre-configured Sphinx with:

  * ``CONTRIBUTING.rst`` guide (used by GitHub when sending a pull request or an issue)
  * ``LICENSE.rst``
  * an empty ``CHANGELOG.rst``
  * this (worthless for most people) ``README.rst`` and a bare-bones ``index.rst`` page

* The exact same files in ``/``, which are fragile and **MAY NOT** be modified
  as they are replaced with copies in ``/docs`` by the ``release``
  script
* ``__init__.py`` and ``template.py`` files in the Python package directory
* A good-enough ``setup.py`` file
* ``tests/`` containing some *Is My Python Sane?*-style tests (using ``py.test``)
* An automated global update script (``.pypt/PYPT-UPDATE``)
* Entry points configuration ready to be uncommented
* Addons for Qt users
* PKGBUILDs for the Arch Linux User Repository (AUR)
* A state-of-the-art ``release`` script, the operations of which are:

  * querying the current branch for version number
  * updating ``/docs/CHANGELOG.rst``
  * bumping the version number in all the files, changing dates where necessary
  * copying over ``/docs/README.rst``,  ``/docs/CHANGELOG.rst`` and ``/docs/CONTRIBUTING.rst`` to ``/``
  * locale generation (via the ``.pypt/localegen`` script)
  * running ``import $project`` and the testsuite
  * uploading a source distribution and a wheel to PyPI
  * committing into git, finishing the ``git flow`` release
  * creating a GitHub Releases entry
